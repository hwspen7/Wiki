          <h1>EQUIPMENT DESIGN</h1>
          <h2>1.1 Research Background</h2>
          <p class="sub">The global aquaculture industry continues to expand. As the world's largest aquaculture nation,
            China's 2023 aquaculture output reached 58.09 million tons, accounting for over 60% of the global total.
            However, disease issues severely constrain the healthy and sustainable development of the industry.
            According to data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), global aquatic diseases cause annual
            economic losses exceeding $10 billion, while China faces direct losses of nearly 60 billion yuan annually
            due to such diseases. Traditional disease prevention relies on chemical drugs like antibiotics, but the food
            safety and ecological issues caused by drug residues are becoming increasingly severe. Vaccination
            strategies based on aquatic animals' immune systems represent the most suitable and focused solution for
            controlling various fish diseases. Meanwhile, the rapid development of digital technology is driving
            intelligent disease prevention techniques (deeply integrating digital and bio-technologies) to become an
            inevitable trend in the green and healthy development of aquaculture.</p>

          <h2>1.2 Technology Bottleneck</h2>
          <p class="sub">The current mainstream vaccination technology has significant defects:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">Injection:</strong>
              It needs to be operated one tail at a time, which is inefficient
              (the skilled manual worker is about 1000 tails/hour/person),
              and the stress damage rate is as high as 8-10%.
              The cost of automatic inoculation equipment is very high
              (the unit price of imported equipment is more than 500,000 US dollars).
            </li>
          </ul>

                Traditional immersion inoculation: although it can achieve herd immunity,
                there are three technical bottlenecks as follows.
              </strong>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Inadequate efficiency and homogeneity: the efficiency of manual soaking is about
                  2000 animals/hour, and the penetration rate of vaccine is only 60%-70%;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Oxygen and density contradiction: high density operation is easy to cause hypoxia stress,
                  resulting in a decrease of immune titer by 30%-50%;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Vaccine activity loss: Open circulation causes high rate of vaccine potency decay.
                </li>
              </ol>

          <h2>1.4 Overall Approach</h2>
          <p class="sub">This project addresses the technical challenges of traditional aquaculture vaccination
            methods—high-stress injections and inefficient immersion inoculation—with two fish-specific live bacterial
            vaccines certified as Class I veterinary drugs. We have pioneered an IoT-powered continuous immersion system
            for smart vaccine administration using Archimedes screw technology. Through systematic experiments, we
            determined physiological stress responses of turbot fry under varying immersion densities and dissolved
            oxygen levels, established safe operational thresholds, and optimized core module designs based on
            immunological parameters. The system integrates conveying units, detection modules, Archimedes screw-based
            immersion units, vaccine stations, and machine vision-assisted post-inoculation sorting. It enables
            continuous fry delivery, uniform immersion, efficient vaccine recycling, and post-inoculation sorting. The
            intelligent control system monitors dissolved oxygen and vaccine concentration in real-time through
            multi-sensor networks (visual, bioimpedance, infrared spectroscopy), while LSTM neural networks dynamically
            optimize inoculation procedures. This ensures dissolved oxygen fluctuations≤0.2mg/L and vaccine
            utilization≥95%. Modular design accommodates 10m³to 1000m³aquaculture scales, achieving 40,000 fry/hour
            inoculation efficiency—40 times higher than traditional methods—with stress damage rates≤0.5%.Application
            validation demonstrates 90% reduction in antibiotic usage and 75% decrease in per-fish inoculation costs,
            significantly supporting sustainable aquaculture transformation.</p>

          <h2>2.1 Transport Unit</h2>
          <p class="sub">To transport fry from aquaculture systems to fully automated continuous immersion inoculation
            equipment, the fish conveying module shown in the diagram was designed. This module features an adjustable
            negative pressure suction pump with a soft silicone suction nozzle that automatically adjusts pressure based
            on fish size (preventing abrasions or minimizing stress responses). The system extracts fry from breeding
            facilities (ponds, tanks, etc.) using PTFE corrosion-resistant hoses, delivering them to a water-fish
            separation plate equipped with high-pressure backflush nozzles for automatic filter cleaning and preventing
            sediment buildup. The aluminum alloy inclined grating panel is impact-resistant and seawater
            corrosion-resistant. Side baffles prevent fry from escaping, while a water collection tank at the bottom
            collects purified water, which is then pumped back into the breeding pond for reuse.</p>
          <img src="/static/upload/page/hardware/hardware3.png" alt="hardware3">

            principle</p>

          <!-- 2.2 -->
          <h2>2.2 Detecting Unit </h2>
          <p class="sub">After undergoing water filtration, the fry slide through the fish-water separation plate onto
            the conveyor belt of the detection and conveying module shown in the figure. While undergoing secondary
            water filtration, the fish are scanned by a vision system embedded with intelligent decision algorithms to
            identify abnormalities and injuries. Fish with surface defects or obvious injuries are excluded from
            inoculation. Side barriers prevent fry from escaping the conveyor belt. The system is equipped with cameras
            that monitor real-time fry density and detect surface injuries. If abnormal conditions (such as color
            irregularities, bleeding, rotting fins, ulcers, or physical deformities) are detected, the fish suction pump
            automatically pauses to prevent diseased or abnormal fish from entering subsequent processes, thereby
            avoiding inoculation damage or cross-contamination.</p>

            principle verification machine</p>
          <p class="sub">After passing through the detection and conveying unit, the fish fry enter a chute equipped
            with a closure mechanism to prevent splashing of fish and vaccine solution. Side panels on both sides of the
            chute prevent escape. The vaccine infusion device pumps immersion liquid from the storage tank into the
            chute, allowing the fish fry and their immersion solution to be transferred into the screw inoculation
            module.</p>

          <!-- 2.3 -->
          <h2>2.3 Immersion Inoculation Unit</h2>
          <p class="sub">To achieve large-scale vaccination effects in small-scale fish fry chambers, a horizontal
            Archimedes screw was employed as the immersion inoculation carrier, leveraging its sealing characteristics.
            The screw features spiral blades along its inner wall that divide the interior into six sealed compartments.
            When viewed horizontally from below the screw axis, each compartment contains independent vaccine solutions
            that remain mutually isolated. These compartments advance synchronously with the screw's rotation. During
            the single-revolution cycle where a compartment travels from the screw's tip to tail, fish fry achieve
            non-assemble immersion and minimal stress response gentle and uniform immersion immunization.</p>
          <p class="sub">The screw head features a baffle positioned above the highest internal liquid level, preventing
            vaccine leakage while maintaining chamber sealing integrity. The hollow rotating shaft connects to a
            dissolved oxygen cone at one end and is perforated with evenly spaced vents to regulate oxygen levels in the
            vaccine. The screw assembly rotates synchronously with its casing, spiral blades, and oxygen delivery shaft.
            Vertical bearing housings support both ends of the shaft, while a coupling at its rear connects to a
            high-torque DC motor for rotation. A built-in camera in the screw head's bearing housing monitors real-time
            inoculation progress, detecting and preventing abnormal fish body conditions during the process.</p>

          <p class="sub">After the fish seedlings are immersed and inoculated in the screw, they are separated from the
            vaccine liquid at the fish liquid separation plate at the tail of the screw and enter the next module; the
            vaccine liquid falls into the vaccine liquid recovery pool below the separation plate, and after filtration
            and disinfection, it is pumped back to the automatic vaccine preparation workstation.</p>

          <h2>2.4 Fully Automatic Vaccine Preparation Workstation</h2>
          <p class="sub">This device features an automated vaccine preparation workstation designed with reference to
            industrial-grade bioreactor technology. By integrating a centrifugal feeding module, robotic arm material
            handling and liquid extraction system, along with a multi-sensor-based immersion solution preparation tank
            (monitoring vaccine cell density/concentration, dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, pH, etc.), it
            creates a stable and high-activity environment for vaccine preparation. This ensures that the vaccine
            potency remains unaffected by external factors during administration.</p>
          <p class="sub">The vaccine liquid bioreactor serves as the core component of an integrated vaccine preparation
            workstation, featuring the following technical specifications: </p>

          <p class="sub">The fully automated vaccine liquid preparation workstation utilizes a centrifugal feeding
            mechanism to transport vials containing lyophilized vaccine powder into a track-equipped conveying system.
            The conveying mechanism incorporates a vial flow current limiter that ensures only a controlled portion of
            vials enter subsequent modules, while excess vials are retained before the current limiter to prevent system
            overloading. Vials are conveyed through the system to slots on a rotating open-capping turntable, where the
            control system adjusts the opener's posture. A servo motor then activates the opener to remove the vial
            caps. Completed vials are guided onto conveyor belts via the turntable, where they enter tracks on the
            conveying mechanism. Discarded caps are routed through slide channels to a dedicated collection bin below.
            The conveyor transports vials to a two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) robotic arm's workspace, where a syringe
            dispenses the lyophilized vaccine powder. The conveyor's precision tracks ensure stable vial trajectories
            during transport. After dispensing, the robotic arm rotates 90° above the vaccine reservoir to inject the
            liquid. It subsequently rotates to a dilution platform for preparing the diluted solution, then completes
            the final injection into the reservoir. A built-in liquid pump on the reservoir side transfers the diluted
            vaccine to an inoculation machine. At the same time, a baffle is installed at the end of the conveyor belt,
            and a slide rail is installed below the baffle. After the liquid extraction operation, the waste vial is
            blocked by the baffle and enters the waste vial collection box set in the frame layer through the slide
            rail.</p>

          <!-- 2.5 -->
          <h2>2.5 Intelligent Sorting Unit</h2>
          <p class="sub">The intelligent sorting unit employs a multi-stage physical screening system integrated
            with machine vision technology to achieve automated and precise fry fish grading.
            The core module features a 15° incline metal grading plate equipped with 5mm fine mesh
            holes at the front and 8mm medium mesh holes at the rear, maintaining a tolerance of
            &plusmn;0.2mm. A spray shower system above the plate generates continuous water film
            through 0.2MPa pressure, assisting fry fishes in sliding while flushing surface mucus.
            An industrial-grade camera mounted on the plate's support frame captures real-time
            movement trajectories at 1920&times;1080 resolution. Visual algorithms simultaneously
            perform three-category quantity statistics (error &lt; 2%) and surface disease detection
            (accuracy &ge; 95%). Three independent collection tanks for small, medium, and large fish
            are positioned below the plate, which are all constructed from PP material with bottom
            discharge valves and swivel casters for efficient transfer after sorting.</p>

          <p class="sub">The fish sorting process operates as follows: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              After inoculation, fry fish enter the grading plate via a slide channel. Guided by a water film
              lubrication system, they naturally descend along the inclined surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              Smaller fish (≤5 cm in body width) first pass through front-grade holes into the small fish collection
              pool. Remaining fry continues sliding to the middle section, where medium-sized specimens (≤8 cm) are
              screened through rear-grade holes into the medium fish pool. Larger unfiltered fish are ultimately
              directed to the terminal large fish collection pool. Throughout the whole process, there are cameras
              continuously monitoring the flock's condition, triggering system alerts if diseased specimens are
              detected.
            </li>
            <li>
              After classification, operators can maneuver the collection pool to designated areas using swivel casters
              and activate bottom valves for centralized discharge, achieving a sorting efficiency of ≥1000 per minute.

          <p class="sub">Screw and support structure: stress and deformation analysis was carried out on the outlet
            support, bearing support and installation platform of the screw system. The results of stress analysis are
            as follows.</p>
          <p class="sub">Screw outlet support: the maximum stress"(σmax)" occurs at both ends of the support, and the
            value is "0.0037 MPa" . This value is far lower than the yield strength of the material valuing 170 MPa,
            indicating that the support strength is sufficient.</p>
          <p class="sub">Bearing support: The " σmax," maximum stress occurs at the bottom of the bearing seat, the
            connection with the platform or the stress concentration area, and the value is 0.04 MPa. It is far lower
            than the yield strength of the material 170 MPa, indicating that the support strength is sufficient.</p>
          <p class="sub">Screw platform: The maximum "σmax," stress occurs around the screw bearing installation hole,
            below the center of the base plate or at the joint of the rib plate, with a value of W MPa. The safety is
            evaluated. It is pointed out that the stress of the three key support components is within the safe range.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Support deformation: The maximum "σmax,0.0039 m" deformation occurs at the top of the support or the free
              end, and the value is. It has little effect on the working clearance of the bearing and can be ignored.

              Lift platform deformation: The maximum "σmax,3.36e-5 m" deformation occurs in the central area of the

              Lug outlet support deformation: " σmax,0.0004 m" the maximum deformation occurs at the end of the
              cantilever, and the value is small enough to be ignored.
              In conclusion, the deformation of each support structure is very small (typical magnitude, such as μm),
              which is within the engineering installation tolerance and bearing working permission range, and will not
              adversely affect the flat stability, smooth operation and material delivery of the screw.

          <h2>4.1 Analysis on Competitive Products </h2>
          <h3>1. Injection inoculation technical scheme</h3>
          <p class="sub">Skala Maskon, a Norwegian company, is an internationally renowned developer and manufacturer of
            fishing vaccination equipment. Their closed-loop injection system utilizes negative pressure delivery
            technology and machine vision to position fish lateral lines, achieving a vaccination efficiency of 10,000
            fish per hour (per unit). The system processes fish weighing 30-130 grams and features an automated
            supporting system with core components including:</p>

          <p class="sub">A. The anesthesia device avoids the shutdown of medicine replacement through the double-chamber
            design and uses the screw conveyor to gently control the delivery rate of fish.</p>
          <p class="sub">B. The buffer tank can be linked with the vision system to accurately calculate the average
            weight of the fish and control the delivery.</p>
          <p class="sub">C. The fish pump system realizes the seamless connection of anesthesia, weighing and
            inoculation, ensuring an efficient and gentle processing process.</p>
          <p class="sub">The whole set of equipment is highly complex (requiring supporting classification modules) and
            costs more than $500,000.</p>

            unit and double unit) </p>

          <h3>2. Soaking inoculation technical scheme</h3>
          <p class="sub">Specifically designed for aquaculture hatcheries, Spain's FFFF (Fish Farm Feeder) has developed
            an automated vaccination system utilizing immersion immunization. The equipment inoculates fish by immersing
            them in a soaking tank containing vaccine suspension, suitable for all fish species with ideal weights
            ranging from 4 grams to 10 grams. Its standard internal barrier features 4-millimeter spacing between the
            grids. Key features and advantages include:</p>

          <p class="sub">A. Adjust the concentration of vaccine solution according to fish species (conventional
            soaking: 108 CFU/ml, high osmotic soaking: combined with 5%NaCl).</p>
          <p class="sub">B. The soaking time can be adjusted (30 seconds to 5 minutes) depending on the type of vaccine
            and the tolerance of the fish.</p>
          <p class="sub">C. The inoculation efficiency can reach 1000-1500 kg/day (average fish weight of 2g per tail),
            and the average inoculation amount is 30,000 per hour.</p>

          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 17. Spanish FFFF fish vaccine intermittent immersion inoculator </p>

          <h3>Technical comparison</h3>
          <p class="sub">Compared with the advanced equipment of French FFF company and Norwegian Skala Maskon company
            (world leading), the innovative advantages of this equipment are reflected in the comprehensive breakthrough
            of inoculation efficiency, precision and fish body damage.</p>

          <p class="sub">A. Processing efficiency: The equipment achieves a continuous inoculation capacity of 40,000
            animals/hour, which is four times higher than Skala Maskon's automatic injection system (10,000 animals/hour
            per machine) and equal to the FFF immersion system.</p>
          <p class="sub">B. Precision of Vaccination: This device utilizes a multi-source sensing system (120fps vision
            + bioimpedance + infrared spectroscopy) and LSTM neural network model to dynamically optimize parameters,
            achieving a vaccine penetration rate ≥95%—equivalent to Skala's injection-grade performance—while completely
            avoiding mechanical damage with a comprehensive injury rate ≤0.5% (compared to 10-15% in traditional
            injections). In contrast, the FFF immersion system relies on a hyperosmotic mode requiring hypertonic
            solutions, which may disrupt the body's internal homeostasis.</p>
          <p class="sub">C. Cost-effectiveness of inoculation: The recycling of vaccine liquid in this equipment reduces
            the cost of single inoculation to 0.03 yuan (compared with 0.12 yuan in traditional injection), reduces the
            dosage of antibiotics by 90%, and is compatible with inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines and
            vector vaccines. In contrast, Skala equipment (cost more than 500,000 US dollars) only supports injection
            vaccines, and the inoculation cost is 300 yuan/10,000 animals.</p>
          <p class="sub">The whole set of equipment is highly complex (requiring supporting classification modules) and
            costs more than $500,000.</p>

          <h2>4.2 Technical Applications</h2>
          <p class="sub">The large flounder (Turbot), a globally valued coastal fish species, has an annual fry
            production exceeding 1 billion. However, its vaccination process remains reliant on manual immersion
            methods, presenting two critical challenges: </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Inefficiency. Traditional vaccination relies solely on manual injection, while immersion techniques
              require batch-wise intermittent operations that lack precise dosage control. With processing capacity of
              only 1,000-3,000 fry per hour, this approach fails to meet large-scale breeding demands. </li>
            <li>
              Stress-induced damage. Injection vaccinations have a 95% survival rate (requiring anesthesia) but
              carry a 5-10% risk of secondary bacterial infections due to improper handling.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p class="sub">The continuous immersion system developed for this equipment is optimized according to the
            biological characteristics of turbot.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Specialized adaptation module. The Archimedes screw compartment volume is optimized to 0.5L/cavity,
              matching the body length of turbot fry (3-5cm), with precise control of vaccine solution circulation flow
              rate at 0.3L/s to ensure uniform contact with fish bodies.
            <li>
              Low-stress assurance. Through multi-source perception real-time monitoring of dissolved oxygen (≥6
              mg/L) and flow rate (≤0.2 m/s), combined with AI algorithm dynamic adjustment, respiratory frequency is
              stabilized at 40-45 breaths/min (traditionally fluctuating up to 80 breaths/min).</li>
            <li>
              Efficient vaccination verification. Pilot tests at a seedling base in Shandong, China showed that the
              system processing efficiency reached 40,000 birds per hour, with a vaccine absorption rate of 98.2% and a
              survival rate ≥99.5%, representing a 15 percentage point improvement over traditional methods.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="sub">Currently, the equipment has already signed two cooperation agreements of intent to establish
            five demonstration sites in major production areas of flounder and halibut farming in Liaoning and Shandong
            provinces, China, with commercial promotion to be achieved by 2026.</p>
