          <h2>1.1 Research Background</h2>
          <p class="sub">In this project, we plan to use Escherichia coli as a substitute for Edwardsiella piscicida to
            construct an engineered strain that exhibits linear movement under blue light and tumbling movement under
            green light. We will further combine this engineered strain with a light irradiation device to achieve
            precise control over the movement state of Escherichia coli, thereby enhancing the invasive ability of the
            vaccine strain and improving the efficacy of immersion immunization. </p>

          <p class="sub">At present, we have completed the construction of four groups of plasmids, which have been
            introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 to construct engineered strains. We have verified that the target
            proteins can be successfully expressed and initially tested their effects on the movement state of bacteria.

          <h1>SECTION 2: Verification of light-responsive pathways</h1>
          <p class="sub">Centered on constructing light-controlled E. coli BL21 engineered strains that move straight
            under blue light and tumble under green light, this project relies on CheA, CheY, and CheZ proteins to
            control bacterial movement. Western Blot and fluorescence detection are key experiments to verify protein
            expression and regulation efficiency, laying the foundation for subsequent movement capability studies.</p>
          <p class="sub">Western blot directly confirms whether target proteins are expressed: Using Flag-tagged
            plasmids (e.g., BL21-pDawn-CheZ-Flag), it detects protein expression differences under light induction.
            Results show blue light significantly increases CheZ expression, confirming the "light signal → target
            protein expression" pathway works; weak bands in dark groups indicate minor basal expression, guiding
            subsequent optimizations.</p>

          <h1>SECTION 3:</h1>
          <h2>Verification 1: Macroscopic Verification via Semi-Solid Medium Culture Assay</h2>
          <p class="sub">To preliminarily verify the motility of the engineered strains, we designed a semi-solid medium
            culture assay. Owing to its semi-solid nature, this medium exhibits both a certain degree of fluidity and
            stability. Utilizing semi-solid medium to assess bacterial diffusive motility (i.e., motility test) enables
            more intuitive observation of phenomena, making it a fundamental and crucial identification technique in
            microbiology laboratories.</p>
          <p class="sub">In our hypothesis, overexpression of the CheZ protein would dephosphorylate CheY-A, thereby
            inhibiting the clockwise rotation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) flagella, weakening their tumbling motility,
            and simultaneously promoting counterclockwise rotation to enhance their straight-line motility. The weakened
            tumbling ability and strengthened straight-line motility of E. coli would manifest as enhanced diffusive
            motility on semi-solid medium, possibly with an accelerated diffusion rate—specifically, forming larger
            colony areas within the same time period.</p>

          <p class="sub">To validate whether the effect of CheZ overexpression aligns with our hypothesized outcomes
            under IPTG induction, we constructed the pBBR1-MCS-5-CheZ system.</p>

          <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5972/uploads/page/results/results10.webp" alt="results10">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 10 Results of semi-solid medium culture for the pBBR1-MCS-5-CheZ system(From
            left to right: Plates 1 and 3 are IPTG-induced groups; Plate 2 is the uninduced control group)</p>

          <p class="sub">From the semi-solid culture results, the colonies in the two experimental groups (IPTG-induced)
            were indeed larger than those in the middle control group (uninduced). This confirms that overexpression of
            the CheZ protein can effectively promote the straight-line motility of E. coli.</p>
          <p class="sub">Conversely, overexpression of the CheY protein or CheA protein (a phosphokinase) would increase
            the production of CheY-A, thereby promoting the counterclockwise rotation of E. coli flagella, enhancing
            their tumbling motility, and inhibiting clockwise rotation to weaken their straight-line motility. The
            strengthened tumbling ability and weakened straight-line motility of E. coli would manifest as reduced
            diffusive motility on semi-solid medium, possibly with a slower diffusion rate—specifically, forming smaller
            bacterial lawn areas within the same time period. To verify whether the effects of CheY and CheA
            overexpression match our hypothesized outcomes under IPTG induction, we further constructed the
            pBBR1-MCS-5-CheY and pBBR1-MCS-5-CheA systems.</p>

            left to right: Plates 1 and 2 are IPTG-induced groups; Plate 3 is the uninduced control group)</p>

            left to right: Plates 1 and 2 are IPTG-induced groups; Plate 3 is the uninduced control group)</p>

          <p class="sub">From the semi-solid culture results, the colonies in the IPTG-induced groups were either the
            same size as or smaller than those in the uninduced control group. This partially aligns with our expected
            outcomes. We hypothesize that this discrepancy may stem from human operational errors during sample
            spotting, which caused slight variations in the volume of bacterial culture added—leading to differences in
            colony size. To a certain extent, this result supports the validity of our initial hypothesis, but further
            verification is required to confirm the exact scenario.</p>
          <p class="sub">In our design, under green light induction, the pSR43.6-pSR58.6-CheA and pSR43.6-pSR58.6-CheY
            systems would overexpress the CheA and CheY proteins, respectively. This would increase CheY-A production,
            enhance tumbling motility, and weaken straight-line motility of the bacteria. On semi-solid medium, this
            would manifest as reduced diffusive motility and a slower diffusion rate—specifically, forming smaller
            bacterial lawn areas within the same time period.</p>

          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 14 Results of semi-solid medium culture for the pSR43.6-pSR58.6-CheA system
          </p>

          <p class="sub">From the results in Figures 13 and 14, there was no significant difference in colony size
            between the green light-induced groups and the non-induced groups. This confirms that the variations in
            colony size observed in the pBBR1-MCS-5 system were likely caused by experimental errors. However, this does
            not sufficiently prove that overexpression of CheA or CheY has no effect on flagellar tumbling motility.
            Similarly, while the colony results from CheZ overexpression in semi-solid medium do not fully confirm
            enhanced straight-line motility, they provide preliminary macroscopic evidence of a potential effect.
            Further experiments are needed to clarify the exact impact of these protein overexpressions.</p>
          <p class="sub">Therefore, we conducted the following microscopic observation assay to investigate bacterial
            motility at the microscopic level.</p>


          <h2>Verification 2: Microscopic Investigation via Microscopic Field Observation</h2>
          <p class="sub">To directly identify changes in the motility of engineered strains from a microscopic
            perspective, we designed a microscopic observation assay to visualize the movement trajectories of E. coli
            in a liquid environment, as shown in the figures below.</p>
          <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5972/uploads/page/results/results15.webp" alt="results15">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 15 Microscopic movement trajectories of strains from the pDawn-CheZ system</p>

          <p class="sub">Figure 15 presents the movement trajectories of four representative E. coli cells selected for
            observation. Microscopic observations revealed that the strains overexpressing CheZ exhibited a noticeable
            enhancement in straight-line motility. Compared to the macroscopic observations from the semi-solid medium
            assay, this microscopic evidence further confirms our expected outcomes.</p>

          <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5972/uploads/page/results/results16.webp" alt="results16">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 16 Microscopic movement trajectories of strains from the pSR43.6-pSR58.6-CheY
            system</p>

          <p class="sub">The E. coli cells observed in Figure 16 were strains overexpressing CheY. Observations of their
            motility revealed a significant decrease in movement ability. This is consistent with our previous
            hypothesis that overexpression of CheY enhances tumbling motility. We propose that if E. coli exhibits
            strengthened tumbling motility and weakened straight-line motility, it would appear as slow in-place
            wriggling rather than rapid movement under microscopic observation. This further confirms the success of our
            strain engineering. The unexpected diffusion results from the earlier semi-solid medium assay may be
            attributed to the difficulty of detecting changes in E. coli flagellar motility using macroscopic
            observation methods.</p>

            infection efficiency using fluorescence microscopy, as shown in Figures 17 and 18. Observations revealed
            that the vaccine strains primarily accumulated in the gills, digestive tract, and skin surface of the
            zebrafish larvae. This is consistent with findings from previously reviewed literature, which indicate that
            vaccine strains typically enter the fish body through these three pathways and then reach immune organs such
            as the liver via bodily fluids to activate the immune response—thereby exerting their function as a vaccine.

          <h1>Section 5: Conclusion and Outlook</h1>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>


          <p class="sub">Our goal was to design a light-inducible system for precise control of Edwardsiella piscicida
            motility. This would allow accurate immersion vaccination in fish. As a first step, we performed
            proof-of-concept studies in E. coli.
          </p>

          <p class="sub">Using pBBR1-MCS-5, we showed that CheZ, CheA, and CheY can alter flagellar behavior. We then
            used pDawn and pSR43.6r&pSR58.6 systems to achieve light-inducible control. Under blue light, cells were
            expected to swim linearly. Under green light, cells were expected to tumble.</p>
          <p class="sub">We successfully constructed 13 engineered strains. PCR and gel electrophoresis confirmed
            correct assembly. Western blotting verified protein expression. Semi-solid assays and microscopy
            demonstrated changes in motility consistent with our design. sfGFP served as a reporter to measure
            light-inducible expression levels. These data supported our prediction of motility regulation.</p>
          <p class="sub">To test translational application, we performed zebrafish immersion infection with
            fluorescently labeled Edwardsiella piscicida. Bacteria localized to major entry points and immune organs.
            This confirmed the feasibility of our proposed vaccination concept.</p>

          <h2>Outlook</h2>
          <p class="sub">Time limits restricted our current work to concept validation. In the future, we will:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Repeat experiments to ensure reproducibility.</li>
            <li>Combine blue- and green-light-inducible systems in a single strain. This will allow ratio-dependent
              control of linear versus tumbling motility.</li>
            <li>Transfer the system to Edwardsiella piscicida. This should enable precise, light-controlled infection
              during immersion vaccination. The strategy may improve efficiency, dosage control, and delivery accuracy
              in aquaculture vaccines.</li>
