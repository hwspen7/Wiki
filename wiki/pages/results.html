          <h2>1.1 Research Background</h2>
          <p class="sub">In this project, we plan to use Escherichia coli as a substitute for Edwardsiella piscicida to
            construct an engineered strain that exhibits linear movement under blue light and tumbling movement under
            green light. We will further combine this engineered strain with a light irradiation device to achieve
            precise control over the movement state of Escherichia coli, thereby enhancing the invasive ability of the
            vaccine strain and improving the efficacy of immersion immunization. </p>

          <p class="sub">At present, we have completed the construction of four groups of plasmids, which have been
            introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 to construct engineered strains. We have verified that the target
            proteins can be successfully expressed and initially tested their effects on the movement state of bacteria.

          <p class="sub">Centered on constructing light-controlled E. coli BL21 engineered strains that move straight
            under blue light and tumble under green light, this project relies on CheA, CheY, and CheZ proteins to
            control bacterial movement. Western Blot and fluorescence detection are key experiments to verify protein
            expression and regulation efficiency, laying the foundation for subsequent movement capability studies.</p>
          <p class="sub">Western blot directly confirms whether target proteins are expressed: Using Flag-tagged
            plasmids (e.g., BL21-pDawn-CheZ-Flag), it detects protein expression differences under light induction.
            Results show blue light significantly increases CheZ expression, confirming the "light signal → target
            protein expression" pathway works; weak bands in dark groups indicate minor basal expression, guiding
            subsequent optimizations.</p>

          <h1>SECTION 3</h1>
          <h3>Verification 1: Macroscopic Verification via Semi-Solid Medium Culture Assay</h3>
          <p class="sub">To preliminarily verify the motility of the engineered strains, we designed a semi-solid medium
            culture assay. Owing to its semi-solid nature, this medium exhibits both a certain degree of fluidity and
            stability. Utilizing semi-solid medium to assess bacterial diffusive motility (i.e., motility test) enables
            more intuitive observation of phenomena, making it a fundamental and crucial identification technique in
            microbiology laboratories.</p>
          <p class="sub">In our hypothesis, overexpression of the CheZ protein would dephosphorylate CheY-A, thereby
            inhibiting the clockwise rotation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) flagella, weakening their tumbling motility,
            and simultaneously promoting counterclockwise rotation to enhance their straight-line motility. The weakened
            tumbling ability and strengthened straight-line motility of E. coli would manifest as enhanced diffusive
            motility on semi-solid medium, possibly with an accelerated diffusion rate—specifically, forming larger
            colony areas within the same time period.</p>

          <p class="sub">To validate whether the effect of CheZ overexpression aligns with our hypothesized outcomes
            under IPTG induction, we constructed the pBBR1-MCS-5-CheZ system.</p>

          <img src="/static/upload/page/results/results10.png" alt="results10">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 10 Results of semi-solid medium culture for the pBBR1-MCS-5-CheZ system(From
            left to right: Plates 1 and 3 are IPTG-induced groups; Plate 2 is the uninduced control group)</p>

          <p class="sub">From the semi-solid culture results, the colonies in the two experimental groups (IPTG-induced)
            were indeed larger than those in the middle control group (uninduced). This confirms that overexpression of
            the CheZ protein can effectively promote the straight-line motility of E. coli.</p>
          <p class="sub">Conversely, overexpression of the CheY protein or CheA protein (a phosphokinase) would increase
            the production of CheY-A, thereby promoting the counterclockwise rotation of E. coli flagella, enhancing
            their tumbling motility, and inhibiting clockwise rotation to weaken their straight-line motility. The
            strengthened tumbling ability and weakened straight-line motility of E. coli would manifest as reduced
            diffusive motility on semi-solid medium, possibly with a slower diffusion rate—specifically, forming smaller
            bacterial lawn areas within the same time period. To verify whether the effects of CheY and CheA
            overexpression match our hypothesized outcomes under IPTG induction, we further constructed the
            pBBR1-MCS-5-CheY and pBBR1-MCS-5-CheA systems.</p>


          <img src="/static/upload/page/results/results11.png" alt="results11">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 11 Results of semi-solid medium culture for the pBBR1-MCS-5-CheY system(From
            left to right: Plates 1 and 2 are IPTG-induced groups; Plate 3 is the uninduced control group)</p>

          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 12 Results of semi-solid medium culture for the pBBR1-MCS-5-CheZ system(From
            left to right: Plates 1 and 2 are IPTG-induced groups; Plate 3 is the uninduced control group)</p>

          <p class="sub">From the semi-solid culture results, the colonies in the IPTG-induced groups were either the
            same size as or smaller than those in the uninduced control group. This partially aligns with our expected
            outcomes. We hypothesize that this discrepancy may stem from human operational errors during sample
            spotting, which caused slight variations in the volume of bacterial culture added—leading to differences in
            colony size. To a certain extent, this result supports the validity of our initial hypothesis, but further
            verification is required to confirm the exact scenario.</p>
          <p class="sub">In our design, under green light induction, the pSR43.6-pSR58.6-CheA and pSR43.6-pSR58.6-CheY
            systems would overexpress the CheA and CheY proteins, respectively. This would increase CheY-A production,
            enhance tumbling motility, and weaken straight-line motility of the bacteria. On semi-solid medium, this
            would manifest as reduced diffusive motility and a slower diffusion rate—specifically, forming smaller
            bacterial lawn areas within the same time period.</p>

          <img src="/static/upload/page/results/results13.png" alt="results13">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 13 Results of semi-solid medium culture for the pSR43.6-pSR58.6-CheY system

          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 14 Results of semi-solid medium culture for the pSR43.6-pSR58.6-CheA system
          </p>

          <p class="sub">From the results in Figures 13 and 14, there was no significant difference in colony size
            between the green light-induced groups and the non-induced groups. This confirms that the variations in
            colony size observed in the pBBR1-MCS-5 system were likely caused by experimental errors. However, this does
            not sufficiently prove that overexpression of CheA or CheY has no effect on flagellar tumbling motility.
            Similarly, while the colony results from CheZ overexpression in semi-solid medium do not fully confirm
            enhanced straight-line motility, they provide preliminary macroscopic evidence of a potential effect.
            Further experiments are needed to clarify the exact impact of these protein overexpressions.</p>
          <p class="sub">Therefore, we conducted the following microscopic observation assay to investigate bacterial
            motility at the microscopic level.</p>


          <h3>Verification 2: Microscopic Investigation via Microscopic Field Observation</h3>
          <p class="sub">To directly identify changes in the motility of engineered strains from a microscopic
            perspective, we designed a microscopic observation assay to visualize the movement trajectories of E. coli
            in a liquid environment, as shown in the figures below.</p>
          <img src="/static/upload/page/results/results15.png" alt="results15">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 15 Microscopic movement trajectories of strains from the pDawn-CheZ system</p>

          <p class="sub">Figure 15 presents the movement trajectories of four representative E. coli cells selected for
            observation. Microscopic observations revealed that the strains overexpressing CheZ exhibited a noticeable
            enhancement in straight-line motility. Compared to the macroscopic observations from the semi-solid medium
            assay, this microscopic evidence further confirms our expected outcomes.</p>

          <img src="/static/upload/page/results/results16.png" alt="results16">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 16 Microscopic movement trajectories of strains from the pSR43.6-pSR58.6-CheY
            system</p>

          <p class="sub">The E. coli cells observed in Figure 16 were strains overexpressing CheY. Observations of their
            motility revealed a significant decrease in movement ability. This is consistent with our previous
            hypothesis that overexpression of CheY enhances tumbling motility. We propose that if E. coli exhibits
            strengthened tumbling motility and weakened straight-line motility, it would appear as slow in-place
            wriggling rather than rapid movement under microscopic observation. This further confirms the success of our
            strain engineering. The unexpected diffusion results from the earlier semi-solid medium assay may be
            attributed to the difficulty of detecting changes in E. coli flagellar motility using macroscopic
            observation methods.</p>

            protein and green fluorescent protein, respectively, and subjected them to attenuation treatment before
            conducting infection assays. Through immersion infection assays on zebrafish larvae, we finally detected the
            infection efficiency using fluorescence microscopy, as shown in Figures 17 and 18. Observations revealed
            that the vaccine strains primarily accumulated in the gills, digestive tract, and skin surface of the
            zebrafish larvae. This is consistent with findings from previously reviewed literature, which indicate that
            vaccine strains typically enter the fish body through these three pathways and then reach immune organs such
            as the liver via bodily fluids to activate the immune response—thereby exerting their function as a vaccine.

          <h2>4.1 Analysis on Competitive Products </h2>
          <h3>1. Injection inoculation technical scheme</h3>
          <p class="sub">Skala Maskon, a Norwegian company, is an internationally renowned developer and manufacturer of
            fishing vaccination equipment. Their closed-loop injection system utilizes negative pressure delivery
            technology and machine vision to position fish lateral lines, achieving a vaccination efficiency of 10,000
            fish per hour (per unit). The system processes fish weighing 30-130 grams and features an automated
            supporting system with core components including:</p>

          <p class="sub">A. The anesthesia device avoids the shutdown of medicine replacement through the double-chamber
            design and uses the screw conveyor to gently control the delivery rate of fish.</p>
          <p class="sub">B. The buffer tank can be linked with the vision system to accurately calculate the average
            weight of the fish and control the delivery.</p>
          <p class="sub">C. The fish pump system realizes the seamless connection of anesthesia, weighing and
            inoculation, ensuring an efficient and gentle processing process.</p>
          <p class="sub">The whole set of equipment is highly complex (requiring supporting classification modules) and
            costs more than $500,000.</p>

            unit and double unit) </p>

          <h3>2. Soaking inoculation technical scheme</h3>
          <p class="sub">Specifically designed for aquaculture hatcheries, Spain's FFFF (Fish Farm Feeder) has developed
            an automated vaccination system utilizing immersion immunization. The equipment inoculates fish by immersing
            them in a soaking tank containing vaccine suspension, suitable for all fish species with ideal weights
            ranging from 4 grams to 10 grams. Its standard internal barrier features 4-millimeter spacing between the
            grids. Key features and advantages include:</p>

          <p class="sub">A. Adjust the concentration of vaccine solution according to fish species (conventional
            soaking: 108 CFU/ml, high osmotic soaking: combined with 5%NaCl).</p>
          <p class="sub">B. The soaking time can be adjusted (30 seconds to 5 minutes) depending on the type of vaccine
            and the tolerance of the fish.</p>
          <p class="sub">C. The inoculation efficiency can reach 1000-1500 kg/day (average fish weight of 2g per tail),
            and the average inoculation amount is 30,000 per hour.</p>

          <h3>Technical comparison</h3>
          <p class="sub">Compared with the advanced equipment of French FFF company and Norwegian Skala Maskon company
            (world leading), the innovative advantages of this equipment are reflected in the comprehensive breakthrough
            of inoculation efficiency, precision and fish body damage.</p>

          <p class="sub">A. Processing efficiency: The equipment achieves a continuous inoculation capacity of 40,000
            animals/hour, which is four times higher than Skala Maskon's automatic injection system (10,000 animals/hour
            per machine) and equal to the FFF immersion system.</p>
          <p class="sub">B. Precision of Vaccination: This device utilizes a multi-source sensing system (120fps vision
            + bioimpedance + infrared spectroscopy) and LSTM neural network model to dynamically optimize parameters,
            achieving a vaccine penetration rate ≥95%—equivalent to Skala's injection-grade performance—while completely
            avoiding mechanical damage with a comprehensive injury rate ≤0.5% (compared to 10-15% in traditional
            injections). In contrast, the FFF immersion system relies on a hyperosmotic mode requiring hypertonic
            solutions, which may disrupt the body's internal homeostasis.</p>
          <p class="sub">C. Cost-effectiveness of inoculation: The recycling of vaccine liquid in this equipment reduces
            the cost of single inoculation to 0.03 yuan (compared with 0.12 yuan in traditional injection), reduces the
            dosage of antibiotics by 90%, and is compatible with inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines and
            vector vaccines. In contrast, Skala equipment (cost more than 500,000 US dollars) only supports injection
            vaccines, and the inoculation cost is 300 yuan/10,000 animals.</p>
          <p class="sub">The whole set of equipment is highly complex (requiring supporting classification modules) and
            costs more than $500,000.</p>

          <h2>4.2 Technical Applications</h2>
          <p class="sub">The large flounder (Turbot), a globally valued coastal fish species, has an annual fry
            production exceeding 1 billion. However, its vaccination process remains reliant on manual immersion
            methods, presenting two critical challenges: </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Inefficiency. Traditional vaccination relies solely on manual injection, while immersion techniques
              require batch-wise intermittent operations that lack precise dosage control. With processing capacity of
              only 1,000-3,000 fry per hour, this approach fails to meet large-scale breeding demands. </li>
            <li>
              Stress-induced damage. Injection vaccinations have a 95% survival rate (requiring anesthesia) but
              carry a 5-10% risk of secondary bacterial infections due to improper handling.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p class="sub">The continuous immersion system developed for this equipment is optimized according to the
            biological characteristics of turbot.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Specialized adaptation module. The Archimedes screw compartment volume is optimized to 0.5L/cavity,
              matching the body length of turbot fry (3-5cm), with precise control of vaccine solution circulation flow
              rate at 0.3L/s to ensure uniform contact with fish bodies.
            <li>
              Low-stress assurance. Through multi-source perception real-time monitoring of dissolved oxygen (≥6
              mg/L) and flow rate (≤0.2 m/s), combined with AI algorithm dynamic adjustment, respiratory frequency is
              stabilized at 40-45 breaths/min (traditionally fluctuating up to 80 breaths/min).</li>
            <li>
              Efficient vaccination verification. Pilot tests at a seedling base in Shandong, China showed that the
              system processing efficiency reached 40,000 birds per hour, with a vaccine absorption rate of 98.2% and a
              survival rate ≥99.5%, representing a 15 percentage point improvement over traditional methods.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="sub">Currently, the equipment has already signed two cooperation agreements of intent to establish
            five demonstration sites in major production areas of flounder and halibut farming in Liaoning and Shandong
            provinces, China, with commercial promotion to be achieved by 2026.</p>
