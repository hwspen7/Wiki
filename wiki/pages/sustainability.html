          <h1>ECECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>
          <h2>1.1 Project Background</h2>
          <p class="sub">As the world's largest aquaculture producer, China's aquaculture output reached 58.09 million
            tons in 2023, accounting for over 60% of the global total. The aquaculture industry has become a crucial
            pillar for safeguarding national food security. However, in the transition towards intensive and
            industrialized aquaculture, infectious diseases have emerged as a core risk to the industry — global annual
            economic losses caused by aquatic diseases exceed 10 billion US dollars, with direct losses in China
            reaching nearly 60 billion yuan annually.</p>

          <p class="sub">Traditional disease prevention relies on antibiotics, which gives rise to food safety and
            ecological pollution issues. Meanwhile, existing vaccine inoculation technologies face significant
            bottlenecks: manual injection inoculation is inefficient (only 1,000 fish per hour per person) with a high
            stress-induced injury rate (8-10%), and imported automatic injection equipment costs over 500,000 US
            dollars. Conventional immersion inoculation is also inefficient (2,000 fish per hour) with low vaccine
            penetration (60%-70%) and prominent conflicts between dissolved oxygen levels and fish density.</p>


          <p class="sub">Against this backdrop, policies such as the Key Areas of National Agricultural Science and
            Technology Innovation (2024-2028) and the National Smart Agriculture Action Plan (2024-2028) have explicitly
            identified "IoT + AI" automatic vaccine inoculation equipment as a key R&D direction. This provides policy
            support for intelligent disease prevention and control technologies, and the industry is in urgent need of
            efficient, low-stress, and intelligent vaccine inoculation solutions.</p>


          <h2>1.2 Project Overview</h2>
          <p class="sub">Relying on 2 nationally approved Class I new veterinary drugs (aquatic live bacterial vaccines)
            developed by the research team, this project pioneers the development of the "IoT Multi-source
            Sensing-driven Continuous Immersion Vaccination System for Aquatic Vaccines". Through a three-tier
            architecture of "sensing - decision-making - execution", the system achieves full-process automation,
            including continuous fish fry transportation, uniform immersion inoculation, vaccine solution recycling, and
            post-inoculation grading and sorting.
          </p>

          <p class="sub">The core modules of the system include a negative-pressure fish suction and transportation
            unit, a machine vision detection unit, an Archimedes screw immersion inoculation unit, a fully automatic
            vaccine preparation workstation, and an intelligent sorting unit. It is adaptable to aquaculture scenarios
            of different scales (10-1000 m³) and addresses the pain points of "high stress, low efficiency, and low
            uniformity" in traditional inoculation methods.</p>

          <h2>1.3 Core Advantages</h2>

          <h3>1.3.1 Leading Efficiency</h3>
          <p class="sub">The inoculation efficiency reaches 40,000 fish per hour, which is 40 times higher than that of
            traditional manual methods and 4 times higher than that of international single-machine automatic injection
            equipment (10,000 fish per hour). The sorting efficiency is ≥ 1,000 fish per minute.</p>

          <h3>1.3.2 Precise and Controllable</h3>
          <p class="sub">Through multi-source sensing (vision, bioimpedance, infrared spectroscopy) and dynamic
            optimization via LSTM neural network, the vaccine utilization rate is ≥ 95%, the fluctuation of dissolved
            oxygen is ≤ 0.2 mg/L, the fluctuation of vaccine concentration is ≤ ± 0.1%, and the sorting error rate is
            3%.</p>
          <h3>1.3.3 Low Damage and Low Cost</h3>
          <p class="sub">The stress-induced injury rate is reduced to ≤ 0.5% (far lower than the 8-10% of manual
            injection). The inoculation cost per fish is reduced from 0.12 yuan to 0.03 yuan, and antibiotic use is
            reduced by more than 90%.</p>
          <h3>1.3.4 Flexible Expansion</h3>
          <p class="sub">In the next 3-5 years, the domestic market scale of intelligent aquatic vaccine inoculation
            equipment will exceed 1 billion yuan. The core target customers include large-scale aquatic seedling farms
            (e.g., turbot seedling output exceeds 1 billion per year), large-scale aquaculture enterprises, and
            cooperatives.</p>
          <p class="sub">Taking a turbot farm with a batch size of 1 million fish as an example, the use of this system
            can reduce losses by 434,700 yuan compared to no vaccine inoculation, and save costs by 298,000 yuan
            compared to manual injection. At the same time, the project can drive the development of industrial chains
            such as vaccine adjuvants and high-precision sensors, and is expected to drive the scale of related markets
            to exceed 2 billion yuan. The overseas market share (e.g., Southeast Asia, South America) will exceed 20% by
            2027.</p>

          <h2>1.5 Financing Needs</h2>
          <h3>The project currently intends to raise 15 million yuan, with the fund usage as follows:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>R&D Investment (4 million yuan): Including core algorithm optimization (Transformer model upgrade),
              development of special modules for shrimp and crabs, and R&D of equipment miniaturization.</li>
            <li>Production Construction (7 million yuan): Construction of a production line with an annual output of 200
              units, procurement of core components (e.g., Siemens PLC, Mettler Toledo dissolved oxygen sensor), and
              establishment of a quality inspection laboratory.</li>
            <li>Market Promotion (3 million yuan): Establishment of 10 demonstration bases in major producing areas such
              as Liaoning and Shandong, and implementation of industry exhibitions, technical training, and preliminary
              overseas market research.</li>
            <li>Operating Reserve (1 million yuan): Covering short-term operating needs such as labor costs and raw
              material procurement turnover.</li>
          </ol>

          <h1>Project Background and Industry Analysis</h1>
          <h2>2.1 Current Development Status of the Aquaculture Industry</h2>
          <h3>2.1.1 Industry Scale</h3>
          <p class="sub">The global aquaculture scale continues to expand. China has formed a full-category aquaculture
            system covering marine and freshwater aquaculture. In 2023, its aquaculture output accounted for over 60% of
            the global total, among which the main marine fish aquaculture areas (4 coastal provinces and 1
            municipality) contributed more than 30% of the output. The annual seedling output of high-end species such
            as turbot and grouper exceeds 1 billion each.</p>

          <p class="sub">From the perspective of the industrial chain, China's aquaculture industry has transformed from
            "small-scale individual aquaculture" to "intensive parks". By 2024, there are over 20,000 large-scale
            aquaculture enterprises nationwide, and the penetration rate of Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) has
            increased by 15 percentage points compared to 2020.</p>
          <h3>2.1.2 Industry Status</h3>
          <p class="sub">The aquaculture industry is an important growth driver of China's agricultural and rural
            economy. In 2023, the total industrial output value exceeded 3 trillion yuan, driving employment for more
            than 50 million people, among which 60% of fishermen's per capita net income comes from aquaculture
            operations.</p>
          <p class="sub">In terms of food security, aquatic products account for 23% of the animal protein intake of
            Chinese residents and are a core source of "high-quality protein supply". In the field of export trade,
            China's annual aquatic product export volume exceeds 20 billion US dollars, of which aquaculture products
            account for 70%. The level of disease prevention and control directly affects export competitiveness.</p>

          <h2>2.2 Industry Pain Points and Challenges</h2>
          <h3>2.2.1 Disease Issues</h3>
          <p class="sub">Diseases are the core bottleneck restricting the sustainable development of the industry. Data
            from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows that global aquatic diseases cause an annual output
            loss of 10-15%, and in China, annual losses caused by diseases such as Edwardsiellosis and Vibriosis reach
            nearly 60 billion yuan.</p>
          <p class="sub">Taking turbot aquaculture as an example, the mortality rate of fish schools without vaccine
            inoculation reaches 20%, and the single loss of an infected pond exceeds 500,000 yuan. Moreover, disease
            transmission can lead to a "devastating blow" to the regional industry (e.g., an outbreak of Vibriosis in a
            coastal area in 2022 caused a 40% reduction in local turbot output).</p>

          <h3>2.2.2 Disadvantages of Traditional Prevention and Control</h3>
          <p class="sub">Traditional disease prevention and control mainly relies on "antibiotics as the main measure
            and vaccines as supplementary". However, long-term use of antibiotics leads to multiple problems:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>First, excessive drug residues. Some of China's exported aquatic products are returned by markets such
              as the EU, Japan, and South Korea due to excessive antibiotic residues, resulting in annual losses of over
              1 billion US dollars.</li>
            <li>Second, ecological damage. The discharge of aquaculture wastewater leads to excessive antibiotic
              concentrations in coastal waters, affecting marine biodiversity.</li>
            <li>Third, increased drug resistance. The resistance rate of common pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Vibrio
              parahaemolyticus) to antibiotics such as florfenicol has exceeded 60%, and traditional prevention and
              control methods are gradually becoming ineffective.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2.2.3 Bottlenecks in Vaccine Inoculation Technology</h3>
          <p class="sub">Current mainstream inoculation technologies cannot meet the needs of large-scale aquaculture:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Injection Inoculation: Manual operation is inefficient (1,000 fish per hour per person), automatic
              equipment is costly (imported equipment costs over 500,000 US dollars), and each fish needs to be
              anesthetized. The stress-induced injury rate is 8-10%, which easily causes secondary infections.</li>
            <li>Traditional Immersion Inoculation: Although it realizes group immunization, it has three major defects:
              low efficiency (2,000 fish per hour), low vaccine penetration (60%-70%), and difficulty in dissolved
              oxygen control — under high-density immersion, dissolved oxygen can drop from 9.1 mg/L to 4.8 mg/L within
              6 minutes, leading to a 30%-50% decrease in immune titer. Moreover, open circulation causes the vaccine
              titer to decay at a rate of over 50% per hour.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>2.3 Policy Environment and Market Opportunities</h2>
          <h3>2.3.1 Policy Support</h3>
          <p class="sub">Multiple national departments have issued policies to promote the development of aquatic
            vaccines and intelligent equipment:</p>

          <p class="sub">The Key Areas of National Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation (2024-2028) explicitly
            lists "intelligent aquatic vaccine inoculation equipment" as a key focus for agricultural equipment
            development, requiring the localization rate of core equipment to exceed 80% by 2028.</p>

          <p class="sub">The Opinions on Accelerating the Green Development of Aquaculture proposes to "continuously
            reduce veterinary drug use and promote vaccine immunization", aiming to reduce antibiotic use in aquaculture
            by 30% by 2025 compared to 2020 and increase the vaccine coverage rate to 80%.</p>

          <p class="sub">At the local level, major aquaculture provinces such as Shandong and Liaoning provide a 30%
            purchase subsidy for intelligent aquaculture equipment, and some parks offer integrated "equipment +
            vaccine" policy support.</p>

          <h3>2.3.2 Market Demand</h3>
          <p class="sub">With the advancement of intensive aquaculture, the industry has an urgent demand for efficient
            vaccine inoculation equipment:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Demand from Large-scale Enterprises: For enterprises with an annual seedling output of over 1 million
              fish, traditional inoculation requires 10 people/day to complete, while this system only requires 1
              person/25 hours, which can significantly reduce labor costs. Moreover, the immune protection rate is
              increased to 98%, reducing mortality losses.</li>
            <li>Demand from Export-oriented Enterprises: Markets such as the EU have strict requirements on drug
              residues in aquatic products. The use of this system can reduce antibiotic use by 90%, increasing the
              qualification rate of aquatic products from 97.5% to 99.8% and avoiding trade barriers.</li>
            <li>Demand for Technological Upgrading: Currently, the domestic market for intelligent aquatic vaccine
              inoculation equipment is blank, and traditional equipment cannot meet the needs of "precision and low
              stress". This project can fill the market gap, and the domestic market penetration rate is expected to
              reach 15% by 2026.</li>
          </ol>

          <h1>Product and Technology Introduction</h1>
          <h2>3.1 Product Positioning and Core Functions</h2>
          <h3>3.1.1 Product Positioning</h3>
          <p class="sub">This system is positioned as a "core equipment for green prevention and control in
            aquaculture", focusing on the vaccine inoculation scenario during the seedling stage of marine and
            freshwater fish. It provides large-scale aquaculture enterprises with a "high-efficiency, precision, and
            intelligent" continuous immersion inoculation solution. At the same time, it can be extended to scenarios
            such as shrimp and crab immunization and precision drug delivery in deep-sea aquaculture, becoming a key
            node in the entire chain of smart aquaculture.</p>

          <h3>3.1.2 Core Functions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Fish Fry Pretreatment and Transportation: Fish fry are sucked out of the aquaculture pond through a
              negative-pressure fish suction pump (with a soft silicone suction head and adaptive negative-pressure
              intensity), and transported to a fish-water separation plate (with automatic cleaning by high-pressure
              backwash nozzles) through a PTFE corrosion-resistant hose for two rounds of water filtration. At the same
              time, machine vision (YOLOv8 algorithm, accuracy 98.7%) is used to identify and automatically remove fish
              fry with surface damage and abnormal body color to avoid cross-infection.</li>
            <li>Uniform Immersion Inoculation: Fish fry enter the Archimedes screw immersion unit (with 6 sealed
              chambers). During the screw rotation and propulsion process, the vaccine solution maintains dissolved
              oxygen (fluctuation ≤ 0.2 mg/L) through a hollow shaft aeration system. The immersion time can be
              precisely controlled (30 seconds - 5 minutes per cycle) to ensure that each fish fry is in uniform contact
              with the vaccine, with a vaccine penetration rate ≥ 95%.</li>
            <li>Intelligent Management of Vaccine Solution: The fully automatic vaccine preparation workstation
              (referring to industrial bioreactors) integrates centrifugal feeding and robotic arm liquid extraction
              modules. Multi-sensors (temperature, salinity, vaccine concentration) conduct real-time monitoring, and
              the LSTM neural network is used to dynamically add vaccine stock solution. The fluctuation of vaccine
              concentration is ≤ ± 0.1%, and the closed-circulation design ensures a vaccine utilization rate ≥ 95%.
            </li>
            <li>Post-inoculation Grading and Sorting: The grading system based on machine vision (OpenCV) uses a 15°
              inclined metal grading plate (with 5mm and 8mm apertures) and a flexible vibrating screen (frequency 12Hz,
              amplitude 0.8mm) to grade fish fry by body width (small fish ≤ 5cm, medium fish ≤ 8cm, large fish > 8cm).
              The sorting error rate is < 3%, and the comprehensive injury rate is ≤ 0.5%.</li>
            <li>Multi-source Monitoring and Remote Control: Users can real-time monitor parameters such as dissolved
              oxygen and vaccine concentration through the IoT platform (industrial host, mobile APP), supporting
              one-click startup, fault alarm (response time < 10ms), and data traceability. The operation interface is
                simple, and the whole process can be managed without professional personnel.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>3.2 Technical Architecture and Core Technology Highlights</h2>
          <h3>3.2.1 Overall Technical Architecture</h3>
          <p class="sub">The system adopts a three-tier "sensing - decision-making - execution" architecture to realize
            full-process automation and intelligence:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Sensing Layer: Deploy multi-spectral cameras (to detect fish surface damage), biosensors (to monitor
              vaccine concentration, accuracy ± 0.1%), dissolved oxygen electrode arrays (resolution 0.01 mg/L), and
              temperature/salinity/pH sensors to collect real-time data on fish status, vaccine solution parameters, and
              environmental parameters.</li>
            <li>Decision-making Layer: An immune optimization algorithm runs on an Edge AI chip (computing power 4
              TOPS), integrating visual data (fish posture), biochemical data (SOD enzyme activity > 100 IU/mL, ALT
              enzyme activity < 50 U/L), and environmental data (dissolved oxygen 6.0 ± 0.2 mg/L, temperature 15 ± 1℃).
                The LSTM neural network is used to dynamically calculate the optimal inoculation density (40 fish/L as
                the safety threshold), immersion time, and fluid replacement frequency.</li>
            <li>Execution Layer: The Archimedes screw system is driven by a servo motor (positioning accuracy ±
              0.1mm), and a pneumatic diaphragm valve (response time < 50ms) is used to achieve precise supply of
                vaccine solution. At the same time, it controls the vibrating screen, conveyor belt, and other executive
                components to ensure the coordinated operation of each module.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>3.2.2 Core Technology Highlights</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Archimedes Screw Fluid Control Technology: Blades are arranged along the spiral line on the inner
              wall of the screw, dividing it into 6 independent sealed chambers to prevent fish fry from clustering. The
              laminar flow optimization design controls the Reynolds number of the vaccine solution between 2000-5000
              (laminar to transitional flow state), with a velocity gradient ≤ 0.1 m/s² to avoid fish body damage caused
              by shear stress. The hollow shaft aeration system and vaccine workstation form a closed-loop control, with
              dissolved oxygen fluctuation ≤ 0.2 mg/L, and the uniformity of vaccine penetration into fish bodies is
              increased by 40%.</li>
            <li>Multi-source Data Fusion and Intelligent Decision Technology: A spatiotemporal attention mechanism
              model is developed to integrate three types of data: vision, bioimpedance, and infrared spectroscopy.
              Federated learning is used to realize cross-device knowledge sharing, and the model iteration efficiency
              is increased by 300%. An LSTM neural network is used to build a dissolved oxygen - density - stress
              response model to optimize inoculation parameters in real time, ensuring a vaccine utilization rate ≥ 95%
              while reducing fish stress (respiratory rate stabilized at 45 ± 3 times per minute).</li>
            <li>Full-process Automation and Modular Design: Each module realizes closed-loop linkage through the IoT
              (Modbus-TCP protocol), and the inoculation capacity can be customized by expanding the number of screw
              units and vaccine workstations. The main body of the equipment adopts corrosion-resistant materials such
              as 316L stainless steel and PTFE, which is adaptable to aquaculture scenarios of 10-1000 m³. The equipment
              configuration cost is reduced by 70% compared with the integrated design. The digital twin platform
              realizes real-time mapping between the physical system and the virtual model, with a fault diagnosis

          <h2>3.4 Intellectual Property and Technical Barriers</h2>
          <h3>3.4.1 Intellectual Property</h3>
          <p class="sub">The project has established a complete intellectual property protection system, as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Invention Patents (4 items): Including "A Continuous Immersion Inoculation Device for Aquatic Vaccines
              Based on Archimedes Screw" and "A Vaccine Concentration Regulation Method Based on IoT Multi-source
              Sensing", covering the core equipment structure and intelligent control algorithms.</li>
            <li>Utility Model Patents (3 items): Including "A Fish Fry Negative-pressure Transportation and Damage
              Identification Device" and "A Closed-circulation System for Vaccine Solution", focusing on the design of
              key equipment components.</li>
            <li>Software Copyrights (2 items): Including "IoT Monitoring Software for Aquatic Vaccine Inoculation System
              V1.0" and "Machine Vision Recognition Software for Fish Fry Grading and Sorting V1.0", protecting the core
              software algorithms.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>3.4.2 Technical Barriers</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Interdisciplinary Integration Barrier: The system integrates life sciences (fish stress physiology),
              mechanical engineering (Archimedes screw design), information technology (IoT, AI algorithms), and
              industrial design (modular integration). It requires collaboration among professionals in multiple fields,
              which is difficult to replicate quickly in the industry.</li>
            <li>Core Algorithm Barrier: The LSTM neural network immune optimization model and the spatiotemporal
              attention mechanism multi-source data fusion algorithm are both trained based on experimental data of more
              than 300 batches of turbot fry. The model iteration efficiency is increased by 300%, and federated
              learning is used to realize cross-device knowledge sharing. The technology is 2-3 years ahead of the
              industry.</li>
            <li>Biocompatibility Design Barrier: The flow field parameters are optimized through CFD simulation
              (velocity gradient ≤ 0.1 m/s²), and the structural strength is verified by ANSYS finite element analysis
              (the maximum stress of the fish separator is 0.01664 MPa, far lower than the yield strength of 316L
              stainless steel of 170 MPa). This ensures the biocompatibility between the equipment and fish bodies,
              reducing the stress-induced injury rate to ≤ 0.5%, which is difficult for similar industrial equipment to
              achieve.</li>
            <li>Industrial Adaptation Barrier: The modular design can be adapted to aquaculture scenarios of 10-1000 m³.
              The core components (such as Siemens PLC and Mettler Toledo sensors) have achieved a stable supply chain.
              The equipment cost is controlled at 225,000 yuan per set, which is significantly lower than the imported
              equipment (500,000 US dollars). At the same time, it will pass the agricultural machinery certification of
              the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (planned for Q1 2026), laying a foundation for industrial
              application.</li>

          <h1>Market Analysis and Competitive Pattern</h1>
          <h2>4.1 Target Market Positioning</h2>
          <h3>4.1.1 Regional Market</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Domestic Core Market: Focus on the main marine fish aquaculture areas (Shandong, Liaoning, Hebei,
              Fujian, Guangdong) and concentrated freshwater fish aquaculture areas (Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi). These
              regions have dense large-scale aquaculture enterprises, with an annual seedling output of over 1 billion,
              and an urgent demand for disease prevention and control. Taking Shandong as an example, there are more
              than 500 turbot aquaculture enterprises alone, with an annual seedling output of over 3 billion, and the
              market demand scale exceeds 300 million yuan.</li>
            <li>Overseas Potential Market: Focus on expanding emerging aquaculture markets such as Southeast Asia
              (Vietnam, Thailand) and South America (Brazil). The aquaculture scale in these regions grows at an average
              annual rate of 12%, but vaccine inoculation equipment relies on imports, and labor costs are rising
              rapidly. This system (cost is only 1/10 of imported equipment) has a significant competitive advantage. It
              is planned to enter the overseas market after obtaining CE certification in 2027.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>4.1.2 Customer Groups</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Core Customers: Large-scale aquatic seedling farms and large-scale aquaculture enterprises with an
              annual seedling output ≥ 1 million (e.g., Oriental Ocean, Haodangjia). These customers are highly
              sensitive to efficiency, cost, and immune effect, and can quickly accept new technologies. The annual
              equipment purchase volume per customer is 1-3 sets.</li>
            <li>Key Customers: Aquaculture cooperatives (jointly established by 50-100 farmers). Through the "unified
              purchase and shared use" model, the purchase cost is reduced. The annual equipment purchase volume per
              cooperative is 1 set, which can drive the use of small and medium-sized farmers in the surrounding areas.
            </li>
            <li>Potential Customers: Operators of deep-sea aquaculture platforms (e.g., aquaculture ships, intelligent
              cages). This system can be adapted to wind and wave resistance design and vaccine cold chain (phase change
              material temperature control, maintaining 4-8℃ for 72 hours) to meet the needs of offshore operations. The
              equipment purchase volume per platform for these customers is 2-5 sets.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>4.2 Market Scale and Growth Forecast</h2>
          <h3>4.2.1 Existing Market Scale</h3>
          <p class="sub">Currently, the domestic aquatic vaccine inoculation equipment market is dominated by
            traditional manual tools and imported automatic injection equipment, and the market for intelligent
            continuous immersion inoculation equipment is almost blank. According to industry research, there are over
            8,000 large-scale aquatic seedling farms in China in 2024. Calculated by an average annual equipment demand
            of 0.5 sets per farm and an average price of 600,000 yuan per set, the existing market scale is about 2.4
            billion yuan. Among them, the demand for "high-efficiency and intelligent" equipment accounts for about 30%,
            corresponding to a market scale of 720 million yuan.</p>

          <h3>4.2.2 Growth Forecast</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Short-term (2025-2026): Complete the construction of 10 demonstration bases, start commercial promotion
              after passing the agricultural machinery certification. The domestic market share will reach 5% in 2026,
              achieving a sales volume of 300 million yuan (selling 500 sets of equipment and 50 million yuan of
              supporting service revenue).</li>
            <li>Medium-term (2027-2029): The overseas market share (Southeast Asia, South America) will exceed 20%, and
              the domestic market share will exceed 25%. The annual sales volume will reach 1.5 billion yuan (1.2
              billion yuan from equipment sales and 300 million yuan from service revenue), driving the scale of
              industrial chains such as vaccine adjuvants and sensors to exceed 1 billion yuan.</li>
            <li>Long-term (after 2030): Become a leading global enterprise in intelligent aquatic vaccine inoculation
              equipment, with a global market share exceeding 15% and an annual sales volume of 5 billion yuan. At the
              same time, expand value-added services such as precision drug delivery and water quality monitoring, and
              form a profit model of "equipment + service + data".</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>4.3 Competitive Pattern Analysis</h2>
          <h3>4.3.1 Analysis of Domestic and Foreign Competitors</h3>
          <p class="figurecaption">Table 5 Analysis of Domestic and Foreign Competitors</p>
          <img src="/static/upload/page/sustainable/table5.png" alt="table5">

          <h3>4.3.2 Project Competitive Advantages</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Efficiency and Cost Advantages: The inoculation efficiency is 40,000 fish/hour, which is 4 times that of
              Skala Maskon and 15 times that of domestic semi-automatic injection equipment. The cost of a single set of
              equipment is 225,000 yuan, which is only 1/10 of Skala Maskon. The inoculation cost per fish is 0.03 yuan,
              which is 75% lower than the traditional method.</li>
            <li>Precision and Safety Advantages: The vaccine utilization rate is ≥ 95%, which is the same as the
              injection effect of Skala Maskon, but no anesthesia is needed, and the injury rate is ≤ 0.5%, which is far
              lower than the industry average. The fluctuation of dissolved oxygen is ≤ 0.2 mg/L, and the fluctuation of
              vaccine concentration is ≤ ± 0.1%, so the uniformity is significantly better than that of FFF intermittent
              immersion machine.</li>
            <li>Intelligence and Expansion Advantages: Multi-source sensing + AI decision-making, supporting remote
              control and data traceability, and easy operation. The modular design is adaptable to 10-1000 m³ scenarios
              and can be extended to shrimp and crab breeding and deep-sea aquaculture, while competitors' products have
              single functions and weak expansion capabilities.</li>
            <li>Policy and Ecological Advantages: Reducing antibiotic use by 90%, which is in line with the national
              "antibiotic reduction" policy. The qualification rate of aquatic products is increased to 99.8%, helping
              export. The closed-circulation design reduces vaccine waste and water pollution, conforms to the trend of
              green aquaculture, and is easy to obtain policy subsidies and customer recognition.</li>

          </ol>

          <h2>5.2 Production Plan</h2>
          <h3>5.2.1 Production Site and Equipment</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Production Site: Located in Qingdao, Shandong (close to the main marine fish aquaculture areas, with
              convenient logistics). The production workshop covers an area of 2,000 m², divided into a machining area,
              an assembly area, a quality inspection area, and a storage area. Among them, the clean assembly area
              (Class 10,000) covers an area of 500 m² to ensure no pollution of vaccine-contacting components.</li>
            <li>Core Production Equipment: Including CNC lathes (for processing screw shafts, accuracy ± 0.01mm), laser
              cutting machines (for processing 316L stainless steel plates), 3D printers (for prototype verification),
              and assembly lines (5 lines, 2 sets of equipment per line per day). Quality testing equipment includes
              dissolved oxygen detectors (Mettler Toledo), vaccine concentration sensors (Dencytee), and vibration test
              benches.</li>
            <li>Production Capacity Planning: The production capacity will be 100 sets in 2026, expanded to 200
              sets/year in 2027, and 300 sets/year in 2028. The equipment production cycle is 15 days/set (including
              processing, assembly, and testing).</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>5.2.2 Supply Chain Management</h3>
          <p class="sub">1. Selection of Core Component Suppliers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Key Sensors: Mettler Toledo (dissolved oxygen sensors), Dencytee (vaccine concentration sensors). Sign
              long-term supply agreements to ensure accuracy and stability, with a stock preparation cycle ≤ 15 days.
            </li>
            <li>Control Components: Siemens (S7-1214C PLC), TowerPro (servo motors). Select first-level agents to reduce
              procurement costs, and establish alternative suppliers (e.g., Schneider PLC) to avoid supply interruption
              risks.</li>
            <li>Structural Materials: 316L stainless steel (Baosteel), PTFE (DuPont). Require suppliers to provide
              material certificates to ensure corrosion resistance (service life ≥ 5 years in seawater environment with
              salinity 30‰).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="sub">2. Supply Chain Collaboration: Build a Supply Chain Management (SCM) system to real-time
            monitor the inventory of components and production progress. The safety stock of core components is ≥ 30
            days' usage. Sign Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) agreements with suppliers to reduce inventory costs and
            improve capital turnover rate.</p>
          <p class="sub">3. Cost Control: Reduce the unit price through bulk procurement (annual procurement volume ≥
            200 sets of components), and the procurement cost of core components is reduced by 15-20% compared with
            small-batch procurement. Optimize the production process (e.g., integrated processing of screw shafts) to
            reduce processing procedures, improve production efficiency by 20%, and reduce unit production cost by 10%.
          </p>

          <h3>5.2.3 Production Quality Control</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Raw Material Inspection: All components must undergo quality inspection before warehousing. For
              example, 316L stainless steel plates need to be tested for yield strength (≥ 170 MPa), and PTFE materials
              need to be tested for corrosion resistance (no deformation after soaking in 30‰ salt water for 72 hours).
              Unqualified raw materials will be returned.</li>
            <li>Production Process Control: Formulate the Production Process Operation Guide. Key processes (e.g.,
              screw blade welding, sensor calibration) must be operated by certified personnel. After each process is
              completed, self-inspection and mutual inspection are conducted, and the next process can be entered only
              after passing the inspection. The Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is used to record production data
              (e.g., processing accuracy, assembly time) to realize full-process traceability.</li>
            <li>Finished Product Inspection: Finished products need to undergo no-load testing (operation for 24
              hours to monitor equipment stability), load testing (simulate fry for inoculation to test vaccine
              utilization rate and injury rate), and environmental adaptability testing (operation at high temperature
              40℃ and low temperature -5℃ for 4 hours). Only after all indicators meet the standards, the Product
              Qualification Certificate is issued before delivery.</li>
            <li>After-sales Quality Tracking: Establish product quality files, record equipment operation data (fault
              type, maintenance times), conduct quality analysis every quarter, optimize the design of high-frequency
              fault components or replace suppliers, and ensure the equipment failure rate ≤ 2%/year.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Sales and Service System</h2>
          <h3>5.3.1 Sales Channel Construction</h3>
          <p class="sub">1. Direct Sales: Establish a professional sales team (divided by region, 2 people each in major
            producing areas such as Shandong, Liaoning, and Fujian). For large-scale aquaculture enterprises with an
            annual seedling output ≥ 1 million, provide "equipment demonstration + on-site test + customized plan"
            services. For example, provide exclusive deep-sea adaptation plans for enterprises such as Oriental Ocean,
            with a single customer follow-up cycle of 1-2 months.</p>
          <p class="sub">2. Channel Cooperation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cooperate with vaccine manufacturers (e.g., Zhonghai Biology, Novus) to launch "equipment + vaccine"
              packages. Vaccine manufacturers are responsible for recommending customers, and we provide a sales
              commission of 8-10% to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results.</li>
            <li>Cooperate with aquatic aquaculture equipment distributors (e.g., Yumeikang, Tongwei), authorize them to
              sell equipment in the region, provide a rebate of 5-8%, and conduct technical training (once a quarter) to
              ensure that distributors have equipment commissioning capabilities.</li>
            <li>Join the China Aquatic Products Circulation and Processing Association and the China Fisheries
              Association, participate in industry exhibitions (e.g., China International Aquaculture Exhibition), and
              hold 2-3 technical seminars every year to attract potential customers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="sub">3. Online Promotion:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Build an official website to display product cases, technical parameters, and customer reviews. Optimize
              SEO keywords (e.g., "aquatic vaccine inoculation equipment", "turbot vaccine immersion system") to improve
              search rankings.</li>
            <li>Publish equipment operation videos and customer interviews on Douyin and WeChat Channels, update 2-3
              pieces of content every week to attract the attention of small and medium-sized farmers. Open online
              consultation channels (WeChat, 400 hotline) and respond to customer consultations within 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Use e-commerce platforms (Alibaba International Station) to expand the overseas market, provide English
              technical materials and video demonstrations for Southeast Asian customers, and the response time for

          <h3>5.3.2 After-sales Service System</h3>
          <p class="sub">1. Technical Support:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Equipment Installation and Commissioning: Dispatch professional engineers (5 regional service stations,
              2 people per station) for on-site installation, with an installation cycle ≤ 2 days. At the same time,
              train customer operators (theory + practical operation, training duration 4 hours) to ensure that
              customers can operate independently.</li>
            <li>Remote Technical Support: Real-time monitor the equipment operation status through the IoT platform. In
              case of faults, engineers can conduct remote diagnosis (response time < 1 hour), and 70% of faults can be
                solved through remote guidance. For faults that cannot be solved remotely, engineers will arrive at the
                site within 24 hours (in main producing areas) and 48 hours (in other regions).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="sub">2. Maintenance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Regular Inspection: Conduct on-site inspections twice a year (once in spring and once in autumn) to
              check the wear of equipment components (e.g., screw blades, seals), replace vulnerable parts (provided
              free of charge, service life ≥ 6 months), and ensure stable operation of the equipment.</li>
            <li>Maintenance Service: Establish spare parts warehouses (each of the 5 regional service stations stores
              100,000 yuan of spare parts). Spare parts for common faults (e.g., sensors, conveyor belts) can be
              replaced on the same day. For complex faults (e.g., screw damage), provide backup equipment (free of
              charge) until the maintenance is completed to reduce customer downtime losses.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="sub">3. Customer Feedback and Optimization:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Establish a customer feedback mechanism (monthly telephone return visits, quarterly on-site surveys) to
              collect customer suggestions on equipment performance and operational convenience, and promptly feedback
              to the R&D team for product optimization (e.g., adding automatic fry specification recognition function
              according to customer suggestions in 2026).</li>
            <li>Set up a "customer satisfaction score" (full score 10 points). Customers with a satisfaction score ≥ 9
              can enjoy a 5% discount on the next purchase. For customers with a satisfaction score < 7, the after-sales
                manager will follow up to solve the problem and formulate an improvement plan to ensure the customer
                satisfaction rate ≥ 90%.</li>

          <h1>Risk Assessment and Response Strategies</h1>
          <h2>7.1 Technical Risk</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Risk Description: Core technologies (e.g., LSTM algorithm optimization, Archimedes screw sealing
              performance) might experience iteration lag, or key components (e.g., high-precision sensors) supply might
              be unstable, affecting equipment performance.</li>
            <li>Response Strategies: Continuous R&D investment (annual R&D ≥ 10% of revenue), collaborate with East
              China University of Science and Technology and Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to establish a
              technology iteration mechanism; sign long-term supply agreements with core component suppliers, while
              developing 2-3 backup suppliers to ensure supply chain stability.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>7.2 Market Risk</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Risk Description: Traditional farms may have low acceptance of automated equipment, holding a "rely
              on experience over technology" mindset; imported equipment manufacturers (e.g., Skala Maskon) might engage
              in price competition, squeezing market space.</li>
            <li>Response Strategies: Demonstrate equipment effectiveness through demonstration bases (e.g., Shandong
              Qingdao Turbot Breeding Base), organize farm visits and learning sessions; launch an "equipment leasing"
              model (monthly rent 10,000 RMB) to lower the entry barrier for small/medium clients; strengthen data
              backing for "low damage + high survival rate," publishing authoritative reports through third-party
              testing agencies (e.g., Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences) to enhance credibility.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>7.3 Production Risk</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Risk Description: After scaling production, controlling processing precision (e.g., screw blade
              tolerance) may be difficult, leading to unstable equipment performance; rising raw material prices (e.g.,
              stainless steel, sensors) may increase production costs.</li>
            <li>Response Strategies: Introduce automated production lines (e.g., CNC machines) to improve machining
              precision (tolerance ≤ ±0.01mm); establish a raw material price monitoring mechanism, sign price lock
              agreements with suppliers (lock price for 1 year); optimize product design, use lightweight materials
              (e.g., PTFE) to replace some metal components, reducing costs.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>7.4 Policy Risk</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Risk Description: Adjustments in local subsidy policies (e.g., subsidy ratio reduced from 30% to 15%)
              could affect user purchase willingness; changes in vaccine approval policies (e.g., new antibody titer
              testing requirements) could prolong the vaccine-equipment adaptation cycle.</li>
            <li>Response Strategies: Strengthen communication with local agriculture and rural departments, participate
              in policy formulation (e.g., lead the development of "Technical Specifications for Intelligent Fish
              Vaccine Inoculation Equipment"), strive for policy support; collaborate proactively with vaccine
              companies, conduct simultaneous vaccine adaptation testing to ensure rapid response after policy changes.
