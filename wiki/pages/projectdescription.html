          <!-- <h2>1.1 Research Background</h2> -->
          <p class="sub">The "Sun Wukong" project,
            led by the School of Bioengineering at East China
            University of Science and Technology and jointly
            conducted by student teams from multiple departments within the university,
            aims to significantly reduce antibiotic dependence in aquaculture through innovative vaccine
            technologies and intelligent vaccination systems, driving the industry's transition toward
            sustainable development. Inspired by the character of Sun Wukong from China's classical novel
            “Journey to the West”, the project transforms his "72 transformations" of adaptability
            and breakthrough spirit into technical design concepts, demonstrating the deep integration
            of traditional wisdom and modern technology. Technically, our team successfully developed a
            novel vaccine delivery system responsive to specific light signals using gene editing technology.
            This system utilizes a biomimetic vaccine robot to achieve targeted penetration of fish immune barriers
            and precise activation of immune responses, thereby significantly enhancing disease resistance in fish.
            Meanwhile, the automated immersion inoculation equipment adopts high-efficiency, non-destructive designs
            to ensure high precision and scalability during inoculation, making it suitable for large-scale farming
            scenarios. Currently, the project has completed application verification at multiple national aquaculture
            demonstration bases. Practice has shown that this technological system effectively reduces
            antibiotic usage and decreases disease outbreak frequency, while simultaneously raising public
            awareness of aquatic disease prevention through cultural practices and science outreach activities.
            The project's achievements provide innovative solutions for marine ecological protection and global
            food security, showcasing the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing agricultural
            challenges.</p>
