          <h1>Questionnaire survey and popular science</h1>
          <p class="sub">In advancing public understanding of aquaculture science and food safety, our "Sun Wukong" iGEM
            club conducted a series of surveys. These questionnaires not only provided valuable first-hand data for our
            research, but also served as crucial tools for public education and awareness campaigns.</p>

          <h2>4.1 Purpose and content of questionnaire design</h2>
          <p class="sub">Our survey aims to understand the public's awareness of fish consumption habits, concerns about
            medication use in aquaculture, and perceptions of fish vaccines. The questionnaire covers multiple aspects
            including frequency of fish consumption, purchasing channels, key concerns, nutritional value understanding,
            health risks associated with farmed fish, and vaccine knowledge. These carefully designed questions are
            intended to assess the public's attitudes and knowledge levels regarding aquaculture practices and food
            safety from various perspectives.</p>
          <p class="sub">Implementation and Feedback of the Questionnaire Survey: Through both online and offline
            channels, we distributed questionnaires extensively and received positive feedback. Participants included
            individuals from diverse age groups, professions, and educational backgrounds, ensuring our survey results
            were more representative and inclusive. Throughout the process, we maintained questionnaire anonymity and
            ensured voluntary participation to enhance data authenticity and reliability.</p>

          <h2>4.2 Data collection and analysis</h2>
          <p class="sub">This survey collected 397 valid questionnaires from multiple provinces and cities including
            Shanghai, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi and Sichuan, with feedback mainly coming through WeChat channels. The
            analysis is conducted from two perspectives: descriptive analysis and multiple response analysis, focusing
            on three dimensions of consumer behavior regarding fish consumption, safety awareness, and perception of
            fish vaccines.</p>


          <h3>4.2.1 Descriptive analysis</h3>
          <p class="sub">Descriptive analysis focuses on the distribution characteristics of a single variable, and
            presents the overall tendency of consumers in fish consumption habits, safety concerns and fish vaccine
            cognition through frequency, proportion and other indicators.</p>

          <h4>Fish consumption behaviour</h4>

          <ol>
            <li>Commonly consumed fish varieties: Crucian carp (58.94%) is the most popular choice, followed by grass
              carp (42.82%), sea bass (35.01%). Marine fish like salmon (26.7%) and cod (22.17%) show relatively lower
              acceptance rates, with only 11.34% choosing "other" species such as loach and blackfish. This reflects
              consumers' preference for common freshwater fish while showing limited acceptance of premium marine
              varieties.</li>
            <li>Frequency of consumption: nearly 70% of consumers eat less frequently, among which "1-3 times a month"
              accounts for the highest proportion (35.26%), and "rarely or never eat" accounts for 30.98%; high
              frequency consumption (3 times or more a week) only 5.08%, and "once or twice a week" was 23.68%,
              indicating that fish has not become a high-frequency daily food.</li>
            <li>Purchase Channels: Traditional markets and large supermarkets serve as primary channels (data is
              implicit and supplemented with sample details). Only 13.85% of consumers directly purchase from
              fishermen/farming households, while 6.05% opt for "other" channels like community group buying or fresh
              food e-commerce platforms. This indicates consumers' reliance on established offline retail scenarios and
              their lower trust in direct purchasing channels.</li>
            <li>Preference for product types: Freshwater fish (57.18%) and shrimp and crab (57.68%) have similar
              preferences, followed by sea fish (34.26%) and shellfish (41.31%), and only 4.79% choose "others",
              indicating that consumers are more receptive to freshwater fish and shrimp and crab, which may be related
              to taste, price and convenience of purchase.</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 6. Statistics of fish consumption behavior</p>

          <h4>Fish vaccine cognition:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Vaccine awareness: 84.64% of consumers have insufficient knowledge about fish vaccines, among which
              "never heard of it" accounts for 42.57%, "heard of it but don't know much" accounts for 42.07%; only
              15.37% are "somewhat familiar" (5.08%) or "very familiar" (5.29%), indicating that fish vaccines have not
              yet entered the public consciousness. </li>
            <li>Post-education vaccine awareness: 66.25% recognized vaccines as "preventing fish diseases and reducing
              mortality", 48.87% understood their role in "reducing antibiotic use", 46.35% acknowledged their
              contribution to "ensuring food safety", 45.09% believed they could "improve production efficiency", while
              11.59% remained uncertain. This indicates that consumers have grasped the core benefits of vaccines
              post-education, though there's still room for improvement in understanding the connection between
              "reducing antibiotics" and "ensuring food safety".</li>
            <li>Vaccine safety concerns: Most consumers have health concerns about vaccine fish, with 46.6% expressing
              "somewhat concerned" and 29.22% "very concerned". Only 9.32% are "not worried", while 14.86% have "never
              considered it", indicating that consumer trust in vaccine safety remains unestablished. It is crucial to
              strengthen public education on "vaccines leaving no residue and posing no harm to humans". </li>
            <li>Understanding of Vaccination Methods: 50.88% reported "completely unfamiliar" with injection, immersion,
              oral administration, etc., while 35.26% "knew one method (e.g., injection)". Only 13.85% "understood
              multiple methods" (5.58%) or were "very familiar" (3.27%). Notably, 92.95% couldn't explain why "immersion
              offers better efficacy", indicating consumers' near-complete lack of understanding about vaccine technical
              details.</li>
            <li>Public Attitude Toward Vaccine Promotion: 67.76% of consumers support fish vaccine promotion, with
              "strongly supportive" accounting for 42.32%, "somewhat supportive but require more regulation" at
              25.44%,28.72% "neutral", and 3.53% "not too supportive or opposed". This indicates that while most
              consumers recognize the progressive nature of vaccines, there remains a clear demand for enhanced
              regulatory oversight and transparency.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>4.2.2 Multiple response analysis</h3>
          <p class="sub">Through cross-frequency and correlation analysis, we dig out the potential correlations among
            various variables, focusing on two core correlations of "consumption behavior and safety cognition" and
            "vaccine cognition and purchase intention".</p>

          <h4>A. The correlation between consumption behavior and food safety cognition:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>The correlation between consumption frequency and nutritional awareness: Consumers who eat fish
              frequently (3 or more times per week) demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of its nutritional
              value. Notably, 88.2% can accurately identify "high-quality protein," while 58.8% mention "Omega-3
              unsaturated fatty acids" – significantly higher than the 40.5% among low-frequency consumers (eating 1-3
              times monthly). Among low-frequency consumers, 15.2% reported being unaware of nutritional information,
              three times the rate of frequent consumers. This demonstrates that increased consumption frequency
              correlates with heightened attention to and awareness of fish nutrition.</li>
            <li>Correlation between purchasing channels and safety concerns: Among consumers choosing "large
              supermarkets/fresh produce e-commerce platforms", 62.3% prioritize "safety certifications", while only
              38.5% of those opting for "traditional markets" focus on safety verification, with a higher emphasis on
              "freshness" (85.7% vs 72.4%). For direct purchases from "fishermen/farming households", 45.5% prioritize
              "production origin" – twice as much as other channels. This highlights significant differences in consumer
              priorities across channels: supermarket/e-commerce buyers value standardized safety labels more, market
              shoppers prioritize visual freshness, and direct purchasers focus more on reliable supply chains.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>B. Correlation between fish vaccine cognition, purchase intention and promotion attitude</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>The correlation between vaccine awareness and purchase intention: Among consumers who "somewhat
              understand/very understand" fish vaccines, 68.8% reported "significantly increased willingness to
              purchase" or "slightly increased willingness," while only 12.5% were "skeptical." Conversely, among those
              who "never heard of/are unfamiliar with" fish vaccines, 42.3% expressed skepticism, with merely 29.5%
              showing increased willingness to purchase. This demonstrates that higher awareness significantly enhances
              consumers' acceptance and purchasing intention for fish vaccines, proving that cognitive understanding
              serves as the critical prerequisite for boosting purchase intent.</li>
            <li>The correlation between vaccine safety concerns and promotion attitudes: Among consumers who "do not
              worry about vaccine safety," 92.3% are "very supportive" of vaccination campaigns. For those with
              "moderate concerns," 65.8% are "somewhat supportive but require stricter oversight." Among consumers with
              "significant concerns," 58.2% are "neutral" or "opposed." This demonstrates that trust in vaccine safety
              directly influences promotion attitudes, with worried individuals relying more on "regulation and
              transparency" to build confidence.</li>
            <li>The correlation between antibiotic awareness and vaccine value perception: Among consumers who "highly
              care about antibiotics," 72.5% recognize vaccines 'role in "reducing antibiotic use," with 68.3%
              "supporting vaccine promotion." In contrast, only 35.8% of consumers who "never paid attention to
              antibiotics" acknowledged vaccines' "antibiotic reduction" value, while 45.2% remained neutral. This
              demonstrates that heightened awareness of antibiotic issues correlates with consumers 'better
              understanding of vaccines' core value (replacing antibiotics), thereby increasing support for vaccine
              promotion.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>C. The correlation between science popularization channels preference and cognitive enhancement needs</h4>
          <p class="sub">Among consumers' preferred science communication channels, authoritative media (58.94%),
            product packaging QR codes (53.15%), supermarket/vegetable market promotions (46.35%), social media short
            videos (43.83%), and community/school lectures (35.77%) are the main choices. Cross-analysis reveals that
            among consumers who "have never heard about fish vaccines," 62.4% prefer "authoritative media explanations"
            and "product packaging labels," considering these two channels as "more credible." In contrast, 58.7% of
            consumers with "relatively basic knowledge about vaccines" rely on "social media" for information,
            demonstrating significant differences in channel preferences between consumers with varying levels of
            awareness: those lacking prior knowledge depend on authoritative sources to build trust, while those with
            foundational understanding prefer fragmented and convenient social media-based explanations.</p>
