          <h1>Synthetic Biology as a Tool for Problem Solving</h1>
          <p class="sub">The use of such advanced scientific tools must be preceded by a risk assessment and careful
            planning of experiments to ensure that all procedures are conducted with appropriate safety measures in
            place. Our team, in collaboration with our educational supervisors and advisors, made every effort to ensure
            that the entire project was carried out as safely as possible.</p>

          <p class="sub">Once we selected the topic for our project, we began considering how to ensure safety,
            especially while working with Edwardsiella piscicida strains.During the experiments ,we ensured that there
            was no biological containmination.We were fully awared that preventing contamination outside the lab was our
            top priority.</p>

          <h1>Risks of the Transgenic Technology</h1>
          <p class="sub">Risks of the transgenic techonology majorly involves gene pollution.For example,
            insect-resistant/herbicide-resistant genes may drift to wild plants through cross-pollination, potentially
            disrupting biodiversity and ecosystem balance.To prevent gene pollution from happening,we established
            physical containment: 50-meter isolation zones for field trials to prevent gene flow.Besides that,we also
            have longitudinal monitoring protocol,through which we can track gene transfer via PCR screening of the
            surrounding flora.</p>

          <h1>Working with Bacteria</h1>
          <p class="sub">We also worked with Edwardsiella piscicida strains, all of which are classified as Risk Group 1
            organisms (non-pathogenic and low risk to humans).</p>

          <p class="sub">Despite this, several risks must be considered when working with these strains, such as the
            spread of antibiotic-resistant genes to other bacteria, unintended overexpression of proteins, allergic
            reactions in some individuals or accidental release of the GMOs into the environment. That's why we
            inactivate them after use and follow Good Microbiological Practice (GMP) guidelines.</p>

            improves the <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">incentive mechanism</strong>. The research team can receive
            corresponding incentives through achievement
            transformation, and the research results can be used for <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">professional title
              evaluation</strong>, providing
            development guarantees for researchers.</p>

          <h3>4.1.4 Safeguard Measures</h3>
          <p class="sub">The state promotes the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements through
            <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">financial investment</strong>, encouraging social capital, and supporting
            financial institutions. This research can
            rely on these safeguard measures to apply for financial and policy support, addressing resource needs during
            the R&D process.
          </p>

          <h3>4.1.5 Supervision and Management</h3>
          <p class="sub">The state strengthens the development of <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">scientific research
              integrity and ethics</strong>, establishes
            a supervision system, and requires research to pass <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">ethical review</strong>
            and comply with resource-sharing
            regulations. This is a core supervision requirement that must be followed throughout the design and
            implementation of this research.</p>

          <h3>4.1.6 Legal Liability</h3>
          <p class="sub">Actions that violate scientific research integrity and ethics are strictly prohibited, and
            research must
            comply with <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">legal, regulatory, and ethical standards</strong>. This clarifies
            the bottom-line requirements and legal
            consequences for non-compliance, providing constraints for conducting research in a compliant manner.</p>

          <h2>4.2 Regulations on the Administration of Veterinary Drugs</h2>
          <p class="sub">Aquaculture vaccines fall under the category of veterinary drugs. This Regulation specifies the
            technical standards and management norms that vaccines must meet throughout the entire chain of R&D,
            production, operation, and use:</p>

          <h3>4.2.1 Research and Development of New Veterinary Drugs</h3>
          <p class="sub">The state encourages the R&D of new veterinary drugs, requiring R&D to comply with <strong
              style="color:#9c7b3f;">safety
              evaluation and quality management standards</strong>, and mandates applications for <strong
              style="color:#9c7b3f;">clinical trials and product
              registration</strong>. This is a key approval link for transitioning this vaccine from laboratory research
            to
            practical application.</p>
          <h3>4.2.2 Production of Veterinary Drugs</h3>
          <p class="sub">Production enterprises must obtain a <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">production
              license</strong>, comply with quality management
            specifications, and ensure product quality. If the industrialization of the vaccine is promoted in the
            future, production qualification applications and quality control must be completed in strict accordance
            with this provision.</p>
          <h3>4.2.3 Operation of Veterinary Drugs</h3>
          <p class="sub">Business enterprises must establish <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">purchase and sales
              records</strong> and are strictly prohibited from
            selling counterfeit or substandard veterinary drugs. This provides a basis for the circulation management of
            vaccines after they are launched, ensuring compliance at the product usage end.</p>
          <h3>4.2.4 Use of Veterinary Drugs</h3>
          <p class="sub">Users must comply with <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">safe drug use regulations</strong>,
            establish medication records, and are
            strictly prohibited from using banned drugs. This clarifies the operational specifications for the final
            application of vaccines in aquaculture, avoiding the risk of abuse.</p>

          <h2>4.3 Law of the People's Republic of China on Animal Epidemic Prevention (Revised in 2022)</h2>
          <h3>4.3.1 Prevention of Animal Epidemics</h3>
          <p class="sub">The state establishes an <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">animal epidemic risk assessment
              system</strong> and implements <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">compulsory
              immunization</strong> for severe epidemics. This provides a clear basis for the R&D direction of this
            vaccine—it must
            focus on the prevention and control of high-risk epidemics to align with national compulsory immunization
            needs.</p>
          <h3>4.3.2 Quarantine of Animals and Animal Products</h3>
          <p class="sub">The production and sale of vaccines must undergo <strong
              style="color:#9c7b3f;">quarantine</strong>, and products must be accompanied
            by <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">quarantine certificates and marks</strong>. This ensures that vaccines
            themselves pose no risk of epidemic
            transmission and is a necessary prerequisite for vaccines to enter the market.</p>
          <h3>4.3.3 Legal Liability</h3>
          <p class="sub">Those who fail to implement compulsory immunization or illegally produce or sell vaccines will
            be punished in accordance with the law [13]. This further strengthens legal liability across the R&D,
            production, and application links of vaccines, forming a complete accountability system.</p>

        <section id="analysis">
          <h1>Analysis of Ethical Issues</h1>
          <p class="sub">On the basis of complying with the legal and regulatory framework, aquaculture vaccine research
            involves sensitive areas such as experimental animals and the application of genetic technology. It is
            necessary to further examine potential ethical risks, specifically from the following dimensions:</p>
          <h2>5.1 Ethical Issues Related to Experimental Animals</h2>
          <p class="sub">This research uses turbot as the experimental subject, and the protection of animal welfare and
            the rationality of animal use are core ethical concerns:</p>
          <h3>5.1.1 Inadequate Protection of Animal Welfare</h3>
          <p class="sub">During the experiment, turbot may face harm due to <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">engineered
              bacteria enrichment,
              near-infrared light irradiation, and UCMs introduction</strong> (e.g., engineered bacteria affecting
            intestinal
            function, and the long-term safety of UCMs being unvalidated). This violates the welfare principle of
            "reducing animal suffering," and experimental procedures need to be optimized to minimize harm.</p>
          <h3>5.1.2 Doubts About the Rationality of Using Experimental Animals</h3>
          <p class="sub">If the experiment directly uses a large number of turbot without first verifying technical
            feasibility through <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">in vitro models</strong>, it may lead to the overuse of
            experimental animals, which is
            inconsistent with the <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">3R Principle</strong> ("Replacement, Reduction,
            Refinement"). Alternative solutions should be
            prioritized to improve the ethical rationality of animal use.</p>

          <h2>5.2 Ethical Issues in the Application of Genetic Engineering Technology</h2>
          <p class="sub">This research relies on genetic engineering technology to modify strains, and the environmental
            impact and controllability of technology application are key to ethical review:</p>
          <h3>5.2.1 Environmental Risks of Genetically Modified Organisms</h3>
          <p class="sub">If <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">engineered bacteria (E. coli, vaccine bacteria)</strong> leak
            into the natural environment due to
            improper operation, they may reproduce abnormally by virtue of their <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">targeted
              adhesion ability</strong>, disrupting
            the ecological balance (e.g., competing for resources, affecting the genetic diversity of native microbial
            communities). <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">Strict leakage prevention and control mechanisms need to be
              established.</strong></p>

          <h3>5.2.2 Potential Uncontrollability of Genetic Modification</h3>
          <p class="sub">Although the single-component light-controlled system has a high success rate, <strong
              style="color:#9c7b3f;">unexpected
              mutations</strong> may occur during genetic modification, leading to the failure of the light-controlled
            switch of
            engineered bacteria. If out-of-control engineered bacteria over-enrich in turbot, they may cause
            unpredictable damage, which may further affect other organisms through the <strong
              style="color:#9c7b3f;">food chain</strong>. The <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">stability
              verification of the modification process</strong> needs to be strengthened.</p>

          <h3>5.2.3 Ethical Issues in the Promotion of Technological Application</h3>
          <p class="sub">f vaccines are hastily put into aquaculture practice without fully verifying the <strong
              style="color:#9c7b3f;">long-term
              safety</strong> of engineered bacteria and their impact on fish populations and ecosystems, it may pose
            threats to
            <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">aquaculture industry</strong> and <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">consumer
              health</strong> (e.g., residual harmful substances, triggering unknown immune
            responses). <strong style="color:#9c7b3f;">A comprehensive safety assessment</strong> must be completed
            before promotion.
