          <h4>2.2 Preparation of LB Medium (150 mL × 9, including 3 batches of solid medium)</h4>
          <p class="sub">Each liter of LB medium contains 10 g sodium chloride (NaCl), 5 g yeast extract, and 10 g
            tryptone. The medium was sterilized using an autoclave at 115°C for 20 minutes. For solid LB medium, 2%
            (w/v) agar powder was added as a coagulant, followed by autoclaving at 115°C for 20 minutes. After cooling
            to room temperature, a gel-like solid medium was formed.</p>
          <h4>2.3 Bacterial Shaking Culture</h4>

          <p class="sub">DH5α and BL21 were taken out of the refrigerator; 100 μL of each strain was added to a culture
            flask containing 6 mL of LB medium, followed by shaking culture at 37°C for 12–16 hours (overnight).</p>
          <p class="sub">Notes: All operations should be performed near a Bunsen burner. Do not place the flask lid on
            the workbench. After use, seal the medium and pipette tips in their original packaging.</p>

          <p class="sub">Summary: The plasmid backbone of pBBR1MCS-5 was amplified, and plasmids were constructed via
            seamless cloning and restriction enzyme ligation. PCR amplification and electrophoresis verification of
            relevant genes and vectors revealed errors in the amplification of the plasmid backbone.</h3>

          <h3>1. Experimental Methods and Results</h3>
          <h4>1.1 Plasmid Extraction (Using a Trial Kit)</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Take the overnight-cultured bacterial solution, centrifuge at 10,000×g for 1 minute, and discard the
              supernatant (aspirate as much as possible). For large volumes of bacterial solution, centrifuge in
              multiple batches to collect the bacterial pellet.</li>
            <li>Add 500 μL of colorless Solution RB (containing RNase A) and vortex to resuspend the bacterial pellet;
              no small bacterial clumps should remain.</li>
            <li>Add 250 μL of blue Solution LB, gently invert and mix 4–6 times to fully lyse the bacteria, forming a
              clear blue solution. A color change from translucent to clear blue indicates complete lysis (lysis time
              should not exceed 5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add 750 μL of yellow Solution NB, gently mix 5–6 times (the color changes from blue to yellow
              completely, indicating thorough mixing and neutralization) until a tight yellow aggregate is formed, and
              let stand at room temperature for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 5 minutes, carefully aspirate the supernatant and add it to a spin column.
              Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute, and discard the flow-through. If the supernatant volume exceeds 800
              μL, add it to the column in multiple batches, centrifuge as above, and discard the flow-through each time.
            </li>
            <li>Add 650 μL of Solution WB, centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute, and discard the flow-through.</li>
            <li>Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1–2 minutes to completely remove residual WB.</li>
            <li>Place the spin column in a clean centrifuge tube, add 30–50 μL of Elution Buffer (EB) or deionized water
              (pH > 7.0) to the center of the column membrane, and let stand at room temperature for 1 minute.(Note:
              Preheating EB or deionized water in a 60–70°C water bath improves elution efficiency).</li>
            <li>Centrifuge at 10,000×g for 1 minute to elute DNA. Store the eluted DNA at -20°C.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>1.2 PCR</h4>
          <p class="sub">The plasmid backbone, CheA, CheY, and CheZ were amplified using the primers designed on August
            4.</p>

          <h4>1.3 DNA Purification</h4>
          <p class="sub">The above PCR products were recovered for DNA purification.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Add 3 volumes of Buffer DP to the PCR tube containing the PCR product, vortex to mix, and centrifuge
              briefly.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to a HiPure DNA column with a collection tube, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1
              minute.</li>
            <li>Discard the liquid, add 600 μL of Buffer DW2, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Repeat step (3) once.</li>
            <li>Discard the liquid, and centrifuge the column empty for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>After centrifugation, dry the column in a 65°C metal bath for 7–8 minutes to completely evaporate
              ethanol.</li>
            <li>Finally, add 20 μL of preheated ddH₂O to the column, let stand for 2 minutes, and centrifuge at 12,000
              rpm for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Re-aspirate the filtrate and pass it through the column again; repeat step (7).</li>
            <li>Discard the collection tube. Determine the concentration of the purified product using a NanoDrop
              instrument, and store it at 4°C for later use.</li>
          </ol>


          <h4>1.4 Electrophoresis and Gel Extraction</h4>
          <p class="sub">The purified products were subjected to gel extraction. Using the E. coli genome as the
            template, PCR amplification was performed with primers BL21-CheA-pBBR1-F/BL21-CheA-pBBR1-R to obtain a
            target fragment with a size of 1965 bp. Similarly, the CheY fragment (390 bp) and CheZ fragment (645 bp)
            were obtained. The theoretical size of pBBR1MCS-5 is 4768 bp.</p>

          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 1 Electrophoresis Image of the Fragments</p>

          <ol>
            <li>First, perform 1% agarose gel electrophoresis to separate the target fragment. Under UV light, cut the
              gel block corresponding to the target fragment and place it in a 1.5 mL EP tube.</li>
            <li>Weigh the gel block, add an appropriate volume of Buffer GDP according to the corresponding ratio, and
              melt the gel in a 55°C metal bath.</li>
            <li>After the gel is completely melted, centrifuge briefly to collect droplets on the tube wall. Assemble
              the HiPure DNA Mini Column, transfer all the solutions to the column, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1
              minute.</li>
            <li>Discard the filtrate, reattach the column to the collection tube, add 300 μL of Buffer GDP, let stand,
              and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Discard the filtrate, reattach the column to the collection tube, add 600 μL of Buffer DW2, and
              centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Repeat step (5) once.</li>
            <li>Discard the filtrate, and centrifuge the column empty for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>After centrifugation, dry the column in a 65°C metal bath for 7–8 minutes. Add 25 μL of ddH₂O to the
              center of the column, let stand for 2 minutes, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Re-aspirate the filtrate and pass it through the column again; repeat step (8).</li>
            <li>Discard the collection tube. Determine the concentration of the gel-extracted product using a NanoDrop
              instrument, and store it at 4°C for later use.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>1.5 Restriction Enzyme Digestion of the Plasmid Backbone</h4>


          <p class="sub">Electrophoresis verification showed that the size of the vector plasmid backbone band was
            incorrect. It was speculated that the reverse PCR primers were designed too close to each other, so Hind III
            was reselected for restriction enzyme ligation. After digestion, gel electrophoresis still showed incorrect
            band sizes.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Restriction enzyme digestion: The target fragment and plasmid with the same restriction
              site were subjected to single or double digestion in the corresponding digestion system to obtain DNA
              fragments with the same sticky ends. Digestion was performed at 50°C for 15 minutes. Taking Hind III
              digestion as an example, the specific digestion conditions are as follows:</li>

          <p class="sub">Summary: Plasmid pSR43.6r was transformed. Since sequencing of pBBR1MCS-5/DH5α confirmed
            correctness, it was speculated that the plasmid extraction kit was ineffective. Therefore, the kit was

            (after purification and gel extraction) and the linearized vector pBBR1MCS-5 were ligated using one-step
            seamless cloning enzyme, followed by transformation into E. coli DH5α to construct recombinant plasmids

              filter-sterilize (aspirate the antibiotic stock solution with a syringe, pass through a sterile filter
              membrane, collect into a sterile EP tube, and store at -20°C).</li>
            <li>Heat and melt the solid LB medium, cool to approximately 55°C, and add streptomycin stock solution at a
              ratio of 1‰ (100 μL per 100 mL medium).</li>

          <h4>2.2 Procedure for pSR43.6 Transformation</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Take E. coli DH5α competent cells out of the -80°C refrigerator, and thaw on ice for 5–10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a biosafety cabinet, add the ligation product to 100 μL of DH5α, gently tap the bottom of the tube
              2–3 times, and incubate on ice for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>After ice incubation, heat-shock in a 42°C water bath for 90 seconds.</li>

            <li>After incubation, centrifuge at 5000×g for 1 minute, aspirate and discard approximately 900 μL of
              supernatant. Resuspend the remaining ~100 μL bacterial solution, spread it on LB plates containing the

            <li>Column equilibration: Add 500 μL of Equilibration Buffer BL to the adsorption column CP3 (placed in a
              collection tube), centrifuge at 12,000 rpm (~13,400×g) for 1 minute. Discard the waste liquid in the
              collection tube, and place the adsorption column back into the collection tube (use columns treated on the
              same day).</li>
            <li>Take 1–5 mL of overnight-cultured bacterial solution, add to a centrifuge tube, centrifuge at 12,000 rpm
              (~13,400×g) for 1 minute using a conventional desktop centrifuge. Aspirate and discard the supernatant as
              much as possible (for large volumes of bacterial solution, collect the bacterial pellet in a single
              centrifuge tube via multiple centrifugations).</li>
            <li>Add 250 μL of Solution P1 (RNase A added) to the centrifuge tube with the bacterial pellet, and
              thoroughly resuspend the pellet using a pipette or vortex oscillator.</li>
            <li>Add 250 μL of Solution P2 to the centrifuge tube, and gently invert 6–8 times to fully lyse the
              bacteria.</li>
            <li>Add 350 μL of Solution P3 to the centrifuge tube, immediately invert gently 6–8 times to mix thoroughly;
              white flocculent precipitates will form. Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm (~13,400×g) for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Use a pipette to transfer the supernatant collected in the previous step to the adsorption column CP3
              (placed in a collection tube), taking care not to aspirate the precipitate. Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm
              (~13,400×g) for 30–60 seconds. Discard the waste liquid in the collection tube, and place the adsorption
              column CP3 back into the collection tube.</li>
            <li>Optional step: Add 500 μL of Deproteinization Buffer PD to the adsorption column CP3, centrifuge at
              12,000 rpm (~13,400×g) for 30–60 seconds. Discard the waste liquid in the collection tube, and place the
              adsorption column CP3 back into the collection tube.</li>
            <li>Add 600 μL of Washing Buffer PW (anhydrous ethanol added) to the adsorption column CP3, centrifuge at
              12,000 rpm (~13,400×g) for 30–60 seconds. Discard the waste liquid in the collection tube, and place the
              adsorption column CP3 back into the collection tube.</li>
            <li>Repeat step (8).</li>
            <li>Place the adsorption column CP3 into the collection tube, centrifuge at 12,000 rpm (~13,400×g) for 2
              minutes to remove residual washing buffer. Open the lid of the adsorption column CP3, place it in an oven
              for 8 minutes to completely dry the residual washing buffer in the adsorption material.</li>
            <li>Place the adsorption column CP3 in a clean centrifuge tube, add 55 μL of ddH₂O to the center of the
              adsorption membrane, let stand at room temperature for 2 minutes, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm (~13,400×g)
              for 2 minutes to collect the plasmid solution into the centrifuge tube. To increase plasmid recovery,
              re-add the eluted solution to the adsorption column, let stand at room temperature for 2 minutes, and
              centrifuge at 12,000 rpm (~13,400×g) for 2 minutes to collect the plasmid solution. Determine the
              concentration using a Nanodrop instrument.</li>

            <li>Starting from 2 hours after inoculation, monitor the OD₆₀₀ of the bacterial solution every 30 minutes
              using a spectrophotometer. It was speculated that the slow growth of the engineered strain was due to low
              viability caused by prolonged storage of the bacterial solution or toxicity from dual resistance. The
              OD₆₀₀ of the bacterial solution reached 0.6–0.8 after approximately 5 hours of culture.</li>
            <li>Dispense the remaining bacterial solution into two Petri dishes (with a specific diameter). One dish was
              set as the light group (induced with a green flashlight for 6 hours), and the other as the non-light group
              (wrapped with aluminum foil for light protection). Both groups were cultured in a 37°C incubator.</li>

              for OD measurement. (The spectrophotometer should be preheated in advance; calibrate with 1 mL of PBS
              before measurement. The OD value measured at this time is for the 10× diluted sample.)</li>
            <li>Determine the final diluted OD value based on the measured OD. An OD value of 1.5 was used in this
              experiment. Take 500 μL of the bacterial solution from Step (3), and calculate the volume of PBS required
              for dilution to adjust the OD of the diluted sample to 1.5.</li>
            <li>Take 80 μL of the above sample solution, add it to a new EP tube, mix it with 20 μL of loading buffer
              using a vortex mixer, and briefly centrifuge with a microcentrifuge to collect the liquid on the tube
              wall.</li>

            <li>Take out the precast 12% SDS-PAGE gel cassette, place the long plate facing outward (placing the short
              plate outward will cause an open circuit), and fix it with a clamp. Pour an appropriate amount of MOPS
              electrophoresis buffer between the two plates; after confirming no leakage, place the cassette into the
              electrophoresis tank.</li>
            <li>Pull out the comb, and pour MOPS electrophoresis buffer into the gap between the plates until the liquid
              level inside the plates is slightly higher than that outside (otherwise, no potential difference can be

              as the marker, and run electrophoresis at 120 V for 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>After electrophoresis, check if the marker bands are fully separated. Pry open the plastic plates to

              membrane and filter papers of appropriate size.</li>
            <li>Soak the PVDF membrane in absolute methanol for 30 seconds first, then transfer it to electrotransfer
              buffer and soak for 2 minutes. Take out the sandwich electrotransfer clamp, and arrange the components in
              the order of "black plate → sponge → filter paper → gel → PVDF membrane → filter paper → sponge → red
              plate" before placing it into the electrophoresis tank.</li>

              deionized water) with 100 mL of deionized water, then add 1 mL of Tween.</li>
            <li>Preparation of blocking solution: 10% non-fat milk powder dissolved in PBS-T. (Add 5 g of non-fat milk
              powder to 50 mL of 1×PBS-T, mix well in a centrifuge tube; store at -20°C if not used immediately.)</li>
            <li>Place the PVDF membrane into the blocking solution and incubate at room temperature for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Primary antibody incubation: Dilute the primary antibody in blocking solution at a ratio of 1:1000 (10
              μL of mouse-derived primary antibody diluted in 10 mL of blocking solution). Transfer the PVDF membrane to

          <h1>9.5 Experimenters：Caijing Wu Yanye Zhang Yixuan Xie</h1>
          <p class="sub">Summary: Bacterial solutions stored in a 4°C refrigerator were inoculated into a bioreactor at
            a ratio of 1% (v/v) with 1‰ (v/v) antibiotics, and cultured until the OD value reached 0.6–0.8. Induction
            was performed with blue light for 3 hours and 6 hours, and the results were observed using a multi-mode
            microplate reader. Secondary antibody incubation and color development were carried out.</p>

          <h3>1. Experimental Methods and Results</h3>
          <h4>1.1 Western Blot</h4>
          <ol start="11">
            <li>After primary antibody incubation, wash the membrane with PBS-T 3 times, 10 minutes each time.</li>
            <li>Secondary antibody incubation: Dilute the secondary antibody in blocking solution at a ratio of 1:1000
              (10 μL of goat anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted in 10 mL of blocking solution). Transfer the PVDF
              membrane to the secondary antibody dilution and incubate at 37°C and 75 rpm for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>After secondary antibody incubation, wash the PVDF membrane with PBS-T 3 times, 10 minutes each time.
            </li>
            <li>Aspirate 1 mL of ECL FemtoLight Substrate and 1 mL of ECL FemtoLight Oxidant, mix them well to prepare
              the developing solution. Blot the residual liquid on the PVDF membrane with filter paper, then perform
              development and photography.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>1.2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader Detection</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>After harvesting the bacteria, wash them with pure water 3 times, and dilute the bacterial solution to
              an OD value of 1 for later use.</li>
            <li>Use a BioTek multi-mode microplate reader: First, turn on the instrument for self-test. Open the Gen 5
              software, select "Immediate Detection", choose "Fluorescence Detection" as the detection method, and set
              the optical component type to "Monochromator".</li>
            <li>Select 488 nm as the excitation wavelength and 509 nm as the emission wavelength, with the optical
              component position set to "Bottom".</li>
            <li>Use a black microplate: First detect the empty plate, then load pure water, and samples induced for 0
              hour, 3 hours, and 6 hours at 100 μL per well. Set up 3 biological replicates for each group.</li>
            <li>Download the data and compare the fluorescence intensity using relative fluorescence intensity.</li>

          <p class="sub">Summary: Preparation of SDS-PAGE gel.</p>

          <h3>1. Experimental Methods and Results</h3>
          <h4>1.1 Preparation of SDS-PAGE Gel</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Take out the matching glass plates, wash them with tap water, and rinse with deionized water.</li>
            <li>Place the long plate inward and the short plate outward, align them, clamp them in a holder, and fix the
              holder vertically on a rack. Pour deionized water to check for leakage; if the liquid level does not drop,
              it indicates no leakage. Pour off the deionized water and blot the residual water with filter paper.</li>
            <li>Preparation of separating gel: For a gel thickness of 1 mm, add 2.7 mL of separating gel solution, 2.7
              mL of separating gel buffer, and finally 60 μL of modified coagulant. Mix well, use a pipette to add the
              mixture between the glass plates until the liquid level reaches below the white crossbar. Then fill the
              gap with isopropanol. Let it stand for about 30 minutes to solidify.</li>
            <li>After the separating gel solidifies, pour off the isopropanol and blot the residual liquid with filter
              paper.</li>
            <li> Preparation of stacking gel: For a gel thickness of 1 mm, add 0.75 mL of stacking gel solution, 0.75 mL
              of stacking gel buffer, and finally 15 μL of modified coagulant. Mix well, use a pipette to add the
              mixture between the glass plates until the liquid level is slightly lower than the top of the glass
              plates. Insert a comb immediately to ensure the liquid fills the gaps without forming air bubbles. Let it
              stand for about 40 minutes to solidify.</li>
            <li>Pull out the comb, remove the gel cassette, add an appropriate amount of deionized water to keep it
              moist, wrap it with plastic wrap, and store it in a 4°C refrigerator for later use.</li>
