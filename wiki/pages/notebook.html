          <h4>2.2 Preparation of LB Medium (150 mL × 9, including 3 batches of solid medium)</h4>
          <p class="sub">Each liter of LB medium contains 10 g sodium chloride (NaCl), 5 g yeast extract, and 10 g
            tryptone. The medium was sterilized using an autoclave at 115°C for 20 minutes. For solid LB medium, 2%
            (w/v) agar powder was added as a coagulant, followed by autoclaving at 115°C for 20 minutes. After cooling
            to room temperature, a gel-like solid medium was formed.</p>
          <h4>2.3 Bacterial Shaking Culture</h4>

          <p class="sub">DH5α and BL21 were taken out of the refrigerator; 100 μL of each strain was added to a culture
            flask containing 6 mL of LB medium, followed by shaking culture at 37°C for 12–16 hours (overnight).</p>
          <p class="sub">Notes: All operations should be performed near a Bunsen burner. Do not place the flask lid on
            the workbench. After use, seal the medium and pipette tips in their original packaging.</p>

          <h3>1. Experimental Methods and Results</h3>
          <h4>1.1 Plasmid Extraction (Using a Trial Kit)</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Take the overnight-cultured bacterial solution, centrifuge at 10,000×g for 1 minute, and discard the
              supernatant (aspirate as much as possible). For large volumes of bacterial solution, centrifuge in
              multiple batches to collect the bacterial pellet.</li>
            <li>Add 500 μL of colorless Solution RB (containing RNase A) and vortex to resuspend the bacterial pellet;
              no small bacterial clumps should remain.</li>
            <li>Add 250 μL of blue Solution LB, gently invert and mix 4–6 times to fully lyse the bacteria, forming a
              clear blue solution. A color change from translucent to clear blue indicates complete lysis (lysis time
              should not exceed 5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add 750 μL of yellow Solution NB, gently mix 5–6 times (the color changes from blue to yellow
              completely, indicating thorough mixing and neutralization) until a tight yellow aggregate is formed, and
              let stand at room temperature for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 5 minutes, carefully aspirate the supernatant and add it to a spin column.
              Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute, and discard the flow-through. If the supernatant volume exceeds 800
              μL, add it to the column in multiple batches, centrifuge as above, and discard the flow-through each time.
            </li>
            <li>Add 650 μL of Solution WB, centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute, and discard the flow-through.</li>
            <li>Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1–2 minutes to completely remove residual WB.</li>
            <li>Place the spin column in a clean centrifuge tube, add 30–50 μL of Elution Buffer (EB) or deionized water
              (pH > 7.0) to the center of the column membrane, and let stand at room temperature for 1 minute.(Note:
              Preheating EB or deionized water in a 60–70°C water bath improves elution efficiency).</li>
            <li>Centrifuge at 10,000×g for 1 minute to elute DNA. Store the eluted DNA at -20°C.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>1.2 PCR</h4>
          <p class="sub">The plasmid backbone, CheA, CheY, and CheZ were amplified using the primers designed on August

          <h4>1.3 DNA Purification</h4>
          <p class="sub">The above PCR products were recovered for DNA purification.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Add 3 volumes of Buffer DP to the PCR tube containing the PCR product, vortex to mix, and centrifuge
              briefly.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to a HiPure DNA column with a collection tube, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1
              minute.</li>
            <li>Discard the liquid, add 600 μL of Buffer DW2, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Repeat step (3) once.</li>
            <li>Discard the liquid, and centrifuge the column empty for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>After centrifugation, dry the column in a 65°C metal bath for 7–8 minutes to completely evaporate
              ethanol.</li>
            <li>Finally, add 20 μL of preheated ddH₂O to the column, let stand for 2 minutes, and centrifuge at 12,000
              rpm for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Re-aspirate the filtrate and pass it through the column again; repeat step (7).</li>
            <li>Discard the collection tube. Determine the concentration of the purified product using a NanoDrop
              instrument, and store it at 4°C for later use.</li>
          </ol>


          <h4>1.4 Electrophoresis and Gel Extraction</h4>
          <p class="sub">The purified products were subjected to gel extraction. Using the E. coli genome as the
            template, PCR amplification was performed with primers BL21-CheA-pBBR1-F/BL21-CheA-pBBR1-R to obtain a
            target fragment with a size of 1965 bp. Similarly, the CheY fragment (390 bp) and CheZ fragment (645 bp)
            were obtained. The theoretical size of pBBR1MCS-5 is 4768 bp.</p>

          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 1 Electrophoresis Image of the Fragments</p>

          <ol>
            <li>First, perform 1% agarose gel electrophoresis to separate the target fragment. Under UV light, cut the
              gel block corresponding to the target fragment and place it in a 1.5 mL EP tube.</li>
            <li>Weigh the gel block, add an appropriate volume of Buffer GDP according to the corresponding ratio, and
              melt the gel in a 55°C metal bath.</li>
            <li>After the gel is completely melted, centrifuge briefly to collect droplets on the tube wall. Assemble
              the HiPure DNA Mini Column, transfer all the solutions to the column, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1
              minute.</li>
            <li>Discard the filtrate, reattach the column to the collection tube, add 300 μL of Buffer GDP, let stand,
              and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Discard the filtrate, reattach the column to the collection tube, add 600 μL of Buffer DW2, and
              centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Repeat step (5) once.</li>
            <li>Discard the filtrate, and centrifuge the column empty for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>After centrifugation, dry the column in a 65°C metal bath for 7–8 minutes. Add 25 μL of ddH₂O to the
              center of the column, let stand for 2 minutes, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Re-aspirate the filtrate and pass it through the column again; repeat step (8).</li>
            <li>Discard the collection tube. Determine the concentration of the gel-extracted product using a NanoDrop
              instrument, and store it at 4°C for later use.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>1.5 Restriction Enzyme Digestion of the Plasmid Backbone</h4>


          <p class="sub">Electrophoresis verification showed that the size of the vector plasmid backbone band was
            incorrect. It was speculated that the reverse PCR primers were designed too close to each other, so Hind III
            was reselected for restriction enzyme ligation. After digestion, gel electrophoresis still showed incorrect
            band sizes.</p>
          <p class="sub">(1) Restriction enzyme digestion: The target fragment and plasmid with the same restriction
            site were subjected to single or double digestion in the corresponding digestion system to obtain DNA
            fragments with the same sticky ends. Digestion was performed at 50°C for 15 minutes. Taking Hind III
            digestion as an example, the specific digestion conditions are as follows:</p>

        <!-- ID：architecture -->
        <section id="architecture">
          <h1>System Architecture</h1>
          <p class="sub">To support the high-reliability, high-intelligence, and high-collaboration design goals of
            the "Smart Vac" system, we architected an advanced, decoupled, three-layer collaborative IoT framework,
            as illustrated in Figure 1. This architecture distinctly separates real-time and non-real-time tasks,
            ensuring both the ultra-low latency of local control and the powerful analytical capabilities of cloud
            services. The overall design balances system stability, scalability, and security.</p>

          <h4>The core of this architecture is composed of three tightly integrated layers. </h4>
          <p class="sub">1.The Perception & Control Layer, acting as the system's on-site "brain", consists of a
            Siemens S7-1214C PLC controller and various high-precision sensors, responsible for the most critical
            real-time data acquisition and autonomous device control. Sensor data is transmitted at high speed via
            the industrial-grade Snap7 protocol to the edge control software. Developed on the robust Qt framework,
            this software runs directly on a local industrial host, enabling direct command issuance to the PLC. The
            primary advantage of this design is its ability to guarantee the autonomous and stable operation of the
            core production process even under extreme conditions, such as a network outage.</p>

          <p class="sub">2.The Application & Interaction Layer is the system's "window" to the user, dedicated to
            providing an intuitive and accessible remote control and data insight experience from anywhere, at any
            time. Its core is the cross-platform control software based on the uni-app framework. We chose uni-app
            for its "code once, deploy anywhere" capability, which significantly enhanced development efficiency and
            ensured a consistent user experience across different platforms.</p>

          <p class="sub">3.At the apex of the architecture is the Decision & Intelligence Layer, the wellspring of
            the system's "intelligence". It operates independently of the core control loop, focusing on
            transforming data into decisions. The cloud-deployed machine vision models invoke vast amounts of
            historical data to perform inference and issue high-level directives, such as "prohibit inoculation" or
            "optimize fish separation frequency". These commands are then relayed to the control layer for
            execution, forming a complete, intelligent loop of "Data-Analysis-Decision-Execution".</p>

        <!-- ID：implementation -->
        <section id="implementation">
          <h1>Software Implementation</h1>
          <p class="sub">Guided by a clear architecture, we translated our layered design blueprint into a suite of
            powerful and user-friendly software applications. Our implementation focused on providing two distinct
            operational experiences: first, stable and reliable core control at the edge, and second, flexible and
            convenient mobile collaborative management in the cloud.</p>

          <h4>1. Edge Control Software: The Localized, High-Reliability Interaction Core </h4>
          <p class="sub">As the primary interface for direct equipment interaction, we implemented this high-performance
            edge control software based on the Qt framework. Its main interface is a highly integrated "digital
            cockpit", as shown in Figure 2. Here, operators can gain a comprehensive real-time overview of the dynamic
            values of six core parameters, including temperature, salinity, and vaccine concentration, while also
            intuitively grasping the device's operational status and the latest event list to ensure immediate
            situational awareness. For in-depth control, the software integrates four task-oriented, independent

          <h4>2. Cross-Platform Control Software: The Mobile, Scalable Management Hub</h4>

          <p class="sub">The cross-platform control software, based on the uni-app framework, resides in the Application
            and Interaction Layer and serves as the core portal for users to achieve remote monitoring and management.
            Its implementation aims to seamlessly extend the powerful control capabilities of the edge to mobile smart
            devices and to expand functionality to meet more complex management needs. To ensure a consistent user
            experience, we replicated all the core functionalities of the edge software on the mobile client—such as
            Data Calibration, Event List, Vaccine Configuration, and Historical Data query—while optimizing them for
            mobile interaction characteristics.</p>
          <p class="sub">The most significant innovation of this software is the implementation of a powerful "My
            Devices" management module, which completely overcomes the one-to-one control limitation of the edge
            software. As illustrated, within the "My" page, users have permissions to "Add Device" and "Manage Devices,"
            allowing them to bring all their "Smart Vac" units under unified management. The device list clearly
            displays the ID and status of each unit. With a simple tap, users can quickly switch their control focus
            between different devices, dramatically enhancing management efficiency and collaborative capabilities in
            multi-device scenarios.</p>
          <p class="sub">Finally, the interface and functions of this software are as shown in Video 1.</p>

          <h1>Machine Vision Model</h1>
          <p class="sub">The machine vision model is the core of the "Smart Vac" system's intelligent perception,
            responsible for transforming raw image information into structured, decision-ready biological status data.
            The entire model is composed of a cascade of two stages: image pre-processing and the core perception
            network.</p>
          <img class="formula" src="/static/upload/page/software/formula1.png" alt="formula1">
          <p class="sub">I(x) is the observed hazy image, J(x) is the desired clear image, A is the global atmospheric
            light, and t(x) is the transmission map. Based on the prior assumption that "in most non-sky local regions,
            at least one color channel has some pixels with very low intensity," the algorithm can effectively estimate
            the atmospheric light and transmission map, ultimately solving for the clear image </p>
          <p class="sub">J(x) via inversion. This provides high-quality input for the subsequent training of the vision
            model.</p>

          <h4>2. Core Perception Model & Performance Validation </h4>
          <p class="sub">Serving as the system's "eyes," we built a deeply customized VoVNet instance segmentation
            network based on the Mask R-CNN framework. Its backbone utilizes the high-efficiency VoVNet, the core of
            which is the One-Shot Aggregation (OSA) module (Figure 3). Unlike traditional networks, it aggregates all
            preceding features at the end of the unit, significantly improving computational efficiency and making it
            particularly suitable for real-time tasks. To further optimize performance, we employed Depthwise Separable
            Convolution to reduce computational complexity and integrated the eSE attention mechanism, which allows the
            network to adaptively focus on more informative feature channels through a three-step
            "Squeeze-Excitation-Rescale" process.</p>
          <p class="sub">The model demonstrates exceptional performance. As shown by the inference results (Figure 4),
            the model can accurately identify and precisely segment the contours of both individual 'Infectedfish' and
            'Freshfish' with nearly 100% confidence. Even in complex scenarios with dense fish populations and partial
            occlusion, the model remains robust, successfully detecting multiple targets with high confidence scores.
            The training loss curve ( Figure 5) shows that the model's total loss rapidly decreases with increasing
            iterations, eventually converging stably around 0.06. Ultimately, the model achieved an Average Precision
            (AP) of 85.7%, a key metric for evaluating object detection performance.</p>

          <h4>2. Core Perception Model & Performance Validation </h4>
          <p class="sub">In the inference stage, we leverage the pre-trained static perception model as a frame-by-frame
            "observation data source" and cascade it with a dynamic spatio-temporal analysis model. This elevates the
            system from a static "image analyzer" to a "video analysis system" capable of understanding the temporal
            behavior of objects.</p>
          <p class="sub">3.1Data Association and Optimal Assignment:</p>
          <p class="sub">This is the core of the tracking algorithm, for which we adopt the classic
            Tracking-by-Detection paradigm. To address the central challenge of associating detections in the current
            frame with existing historical trajectories, we first construct a cost matrix. The elements of this matrix
            are derived from the Intersection over Union (IoU), which is mathematically defined as:</p>
          <img class="formula" style="height: 70px;" src="/static/upload/page/software/formula2.png" alt="formula2">
          <p class="sub">Subsequently, we employ a solver based on the Hungarian algorithm to find the globally optimal
            assignment for the cost matrix. This process matches each historical trajectory to a unique new detection
            with the minimum possible total cost, thereby maintaining identity consistency across frames.</p>

          <p class="sub">To ensure that the object's tracked trajectory is visually coherent and free from jitter, we
            apply an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model to smooth the bounding box positions. Its mathematical
            expression is:"S" _"t" "=α⋅" "Y" _"t" "+(1-α)⋅" "S" _"t-1" ,Here, St represents the smoothed coordinates in
            the current frame, Yt are the raw detected coordinates in the current frame, St−1 are the smoothed
            coordinates from the previous frame, and α is the smoothing factor, which determines the degree of smoothing
            and the responsiveness to new observations.</p>

          <h1>Control System Model</h1>
          <p class="sub">To achieve ultra-high-precision and stable control of key environmental parameters during the
            vaccine production process, we have designed an advanced multi-variable, multi-strategy intelligent control
            system. This system tailors optimal composite control strategies for the unique dynamic characteristics
            (e.g., non-linearity, time-delay, actuator coupling) of different controlled variables, such as temperature,
            dissolved oxygen, and pH. This approach allows for the construction of a highly efficient, robust, and
            intelligent control core. The table below presents the variables we need to control and their requirements.

          <h4>1. Temperature Control: A Hybrid Intelligent Strategy with Neural Networks and Feedforward Compensation:
          </h4>
          <p class="sub">Recognizing that temperature is a critical variable with the slowest response and strongest
            non-linearity, we designed a hybrid intelligent control scheme combining adaptive feedback with predictive
            feedforward. At its core is an adaptive PID controller based on a Back-Propagation (BP) Neural Network. This
            network, with a 4-7-3 architecture, not only uses the conventional error e(k) and error rate de(k) as inputs
            but also innovatively incorporates measurable disturbances like coolant flow rate F(k) and inlet temperature
            Tin(k), endowing the controller with predictive adjustment capabilities. Through online learning, the
            network can perform real-time, dynamic self-tuning of the PID parameters (Kp,Ki,Kd) to adapt to the
            reactor's changing dynamics under various operating conditions.</p>
          <p class="sub">To further enhance performance, we introduced a Hybrid Feedforward Compensator (HFF) to
            proactively and rapidly counteract external disturbances. This compensator includes: a static feedforward
            component based on the system's steady-state energy balance equation to compensate for measurable
            disturbances; and a dynamic feedforward component based on a disturbance observer, which compensates for
            unmeasurable disturbances and model uncertainties by estimating a "lumped disturbance term" online.</p>

          <h4>2. Dissolved Oxygen, pH, and Salinity Control: A Two-Degree-of-Freedom PID Decoupling Strategy:</h4>
          <p class="sub">For variables like dissolved oxygen, pH, and salinity, which require a simultaneous balance
            between fast setpoint tracking and robust disturbance rejection, we employed a Two-Degree-of-Freedom PID
            (2DOF-PID) controller. A conventional PID controller faces an inherent trade-off between these two
            performance objectives. The 2DOF-PID successfully decouples these functions by introducing additional
            setpoint weighting factors, b and c, on the proportional and derivative terms. This allows us to
            independently optimize the controller's response to setpoint changes and external disturbances, achieving
            smoother, overshoot-free setpoint tracking without sacrificing disturbance rejection capability. Its control
            law is given by the following equation, where R(s) is the setpoint and Y(s) is the measured output:</p>

          <h4>3. Controller Parameter Tuning</h4>
          <p class="sub">To ensure optimal controller performance, we used the MOMI analytical method to obtain initial
            values for the PID parameters. This method is based on an open-loop step response, from which multiple
            integral areas Ai under the response curve are calculated. The PID parameters are then determined using the
            following formulas:</p>

            this multi-variable control system, including setpoint generation, parallel operation of multiple
            controllers, the reactor model, and signal feedback.</p>

          <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
          <p class="sub">Focusing on our project plan, we have successfully achieved breakthroughs in key technical
            areas, delivering an integrated software solution that spans from low-level real-time control to high-level
            intelligent decision-making. This system not only validates the feasibility of combining high-reliability
            edge computing with high-flexibility cloud management but also integrates preliminary deep learning-based
            computer vision models and a multi-variable control system founded on advanced process control theory.
            Collectively, this work lays a solid technical foundation for realizing the vision of an intelligent
            traditional vaccination process.</p>

          <p class="sub">Commercial bioprocess automation software often presents challenges such as high costs and
            proprietary systems, which can limit its widespread adoption in academic research. In contrast, the "Smart
            Vac" system is built upon a modular architecture and mainstream open-source technologies, aiming to enhance
            its scalability and portability. It is our hope that future iGEM teams and other research projects can adapt
            our vision algorithms, control models, or system architecture for novel bioprocess automation scenarios,
            which could in turn increase the project's reuse value and contribute to the iGEM community.</p>


          <p class="sub">In summary, the significance of the "Smart Vac" system extends beyond providing an open-source,
            reusable tool for academic research. More importantly, it serves as an exploratory paradigm, demonstrating
            how cutting-edge information technologies like IoT, edge computing, and machine learning can be deeply
            integrated with applications in synthetic biology. Through this integration, we have elevated a traditional,
            labor-intensive bioprocess into a highly efficient, precise, and traceable digital production paradigm,
            showcasing significant potential for enhancing production efficiency, process stability, and data
            traceability. Therefore, this project is more than an effective attempt to solve a specific problem; it
            provides a field-tested, robust, and open engineering blueprint for the future development of smart
            agriculture and automated biotechnology.</p>
