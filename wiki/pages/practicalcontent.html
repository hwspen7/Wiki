          <h1>GENERAL</h1>
          <p class="sub">We are a research team at East China University of Science and Technology. This project
            originated from our profound commitment to addressing key technological challenges in modern agricultural
            development, with particular focus on resolving disease issues that persistently affect aquaculture
            industries worldwide. Through systematic research on fish diseases, development of fish vaccines, and
            related equipment, we successfully developed the "Sun Wukong Fish Vaccine" and its accompanying inoculation
            system. During this process, our team gained invaluable interdisciplinary experience: We established deep
            collaborations with experts from various fields through continuous dialogue, multi-party consultations, and
            partnership building, strengthening academic-industrial connections. Simultaneously, we conducted in-depth
            exchanges with frontline aquaculture farmers who have witnessed the real-world impacts of fish diseases,
            ensuring close alignment between research design and practical needs.</p>

          <p class="sub">Furthermore, this project aims to achieve multidimensional breakthroughs: while ensuring
            user-friendly tools with significant cost-effectiveness and accessibility, it emphasizes integrating diverse
            perspectives to enhance the universality and innovation of solutions. Team members, driven by environmental
            awareness, actively participate in social practices dedicated to advancing sustainable agricultural
            initiatives.</p>

          <h1>HOW DID WE START?</h1>
          <h2>2.1 Social Background Research —— September 2024 </h2>
          <p class="sub">As a core technological approach in modern aquaculture disease prevention and control, fish
            vaccination plays a direct role in the sustainable development of global aquaculture. Current mainstream
            vaccination methods include injection, immersion, and oral administration. Our survey of aquaculture
            enterprises reveals that all these companies currently face significant technical bottlenecks in this field.
          </p>
          <p class="sub">While injection method ensures precise vaccine administration, it requires individual handling
            of each fish, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. This approach not only incurs high labor
            costs but also easily triggers stress responses in fish, making it nearly impossible to implement in
            large-scale aquaculture farms processing tens of thousands of fry daily. The immersion method, though simple
            to operate, suffers from low vaccine utilization rates (typically under 5%) and significant variations in
            immune efficacy among individuals. Oral vaccination faces dual challenges——: overcoming digestive enzyme
            degradation and breaking through intestinal mucosal barriers, leading to unstable immune responses.</p>
          <p class="sub">Intravenous vaccination remains the standard practice for fish immunization, offering precise
            dose control to ensure each individual receives accurate administration. This proves particularly crucial
            for vaccines requiring specific dosage thresholds to elicit effective immune responses. However, this method
            presents significant limitations: Each fish must be individually handled, a time-consuming and
            labor-intensive process. In large-scale aquaculture operations handling tens of thousands of fry daily, such
            traditional methods prove nearly impossible to implement. Take Norway's Lumic LV8 semi-automatic injection
            system as an example: equipped with eight injection channels, it requires four operators to vaccinate 20,000
            fish per hour. Even for salmon hatcheries producing 20 million fry annually, the entire vaccination process
            would take 1,000 hours—— an impractical timeframe for industrial-scale operations[1]. Moreover, the
            injection procedure inherently induces stress responses in fish. These physiological reactions weaken their
            immune systems, making them more susceptible to secondary infections that ultimately reduce overall growth
            rates and survival rates.</p>
          <img src="/static/upload/page/practicalcontent/practicalcontent1.png" alt="practicalcontent1">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 1. Injection inoculation</p>

          <p class="sub">In contrast, the immersion method is relatively straightforward. Fish are placed in a
            vaccine-containing solution, where the vaccine gets absorbed through their gills and skin. However, this
            approach suffers from low vaccine efficacy, typically below 5%. This occurs because most vaccine remains in
            the water, failing to be effectively absorbed by fish. Notably, studies have found that factors like fish
            gill structure and skin mucus further hinder vaccine absorption, exacerbating the inefficiency[2]. Moreover,
            there's significant variation in immune response across individuals. Factors such as fish size, health
            status, and swimming behavior all influence vaccine uptake, resulting in uneven immune protection
            effectiveness among different fish populations.</p>

          <img src="/static/upload/page/practicalcontent/practicalcontent2.png" alt="practicalcontent2">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 2. Bubble inoculation</p>


          <p class="sub">Oral vaccines present an alternative approach, yet they face dual challenges: enzymatic
            degradation in the digestive tract and the intestinal mucosal barrier. The digestive enzymes in fish
            intestines break down vaccine components, reducing their efficacy. Meanwhile, the intestinal mucosal
            barrier—which should protect against foreign substances—may hinder full absorption. Furthermore, since oral
            vaccination relies on feeding behavior, inconsistent administration can leave some fish unvaccinated—a
            critical practical issue [2]. Consequently, oral vaccines often induce unstable immune responses, making it
            difficult to achieve sustained disease prevention.</p>
          <p class="sub">In summary, while fish vaccination is vital for aquaculture, existing mainstream methods have
            inherent limitations. Addressing these challenges not only plays a key role in enhancing disease prevention
            efficiency but also presents a pivotal opportunity to transition the industry from the "antibiotic era" to
            the "vaccine era" [3]. Overcoming these technical barriers will be crucial for advancing fish vaccines and
            their widespread application, injecting new momentum into the sustainable and healthy development of global
            aquaculture.</p>

          <h2>2.2 Target User Group and Market Demand Analysis ——October 2024 </h2>
          <h3>2.2.1 Target User Groups</h3>
          <h4>Diet Consumer Groups</h4>

          <p class="sub">The modern consumer's pursuit of healthy eating has fueled the booming market for premium
            aquatic products. As an ideal low-fat, high-protein food (averaging 18-22g protein per 50g) rich in EPA/DHA
            (with Omega-3 fatty acids reaching 1-2g per 50g), global annual consumption per capita has surpassed 20.5kg.
            Notably, high-nutrient fish like rainbow trout and tuna are seeing annual demand growth rates exceeding 12%,
            particularly among fitness enthusiasts, pregnant and postpartum individuals, and those at high risk of
            cardiovascular diseases.</p>
          <img src="/static/upload/page/practicalcontent/practicalcontent4.png" alt="practicalcontent4">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 4. Fish ingredients</p>

          <h4>Pharmaceutical/Health products</h4>

          <p class="sub">The global market size of fish oil health products has exceeded 4 billion US dollars, among
            which high-end products such as DHA seaweed oil and krill oil have increased by 18%. These functional
            products for infant brain development and prevention of cognitive impairment in the elderly are particularly
            strict on vaccine safety.</p>
          <img src="/static/upload/page/practicalcontent/practicalcontent5.png" alt="practicalcontent5">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 5. Fish oil health products</p>

          <h4>Fish Collagen Cosmetics</h4>

          <p class="sub">Fish collagen has become a game-changer in skincare with its exceptional moisturizing and
            anti-wrinkle properties. Featuring a unique Type I collagen structure (with a molecular weight of 280-300
            kDa), it delivers 30% better hydration than land-based collagen. Leading global brands like Estée Lauder and
            Shiseido have launched their "Ocean Skincare" collections containing fish collagen, which now generate over
            $1.5 billion in annual sales.</p>
          <img src="/static/upload/page/practicalcontent/practicalcontent6.png" alt="practicalcontent6">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 6. Fish collagen cosmetics</p>

          <h4>Fish Skin Products</h4>

          <p class="sub">Fish skin leather, a sustainable fashion material, has gained popularity among eco-conscious
            consumers embracing the "fishery-first" philosophy. For instance, salmon skin leather delivers 80% of the
            tear resistance of genuine cowhide while reducing its carbon footprint by a factor of ten. Eco-forward
            brands like Stella McCartney have launched premium fish-skin handbags priced over $2,000, with annual
            production growth rates reaching a remarkable 25%.</p>
          <img src="/static/upload/page/practicalcontent/practicalcontent7.png" alt="practicalcontent7">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 7. Fish skin products</p>


          <h3>2.2.2 Market Demand</h3>
          <p class="sub">In 2024, the total output of global fisheries and aquaculture reached 223.2 million tons, with
            aquaculture production accounting for 59%, surpassing fishing for the first time. As the world's largest
            producer of aquatic products, China's total output in 2024 was 74.1 million tons, with aquaculture
            production reaching 60.8 million tons, representing a significant 82% share. It is projected that by 2029,
            the global fish vaccine market will reach $680 million, with a compound annual growth rate of 9.2%. The data
            indicates that the market demand for fish products continues to expand and rise year by year.</p>
          <p class="sub">The global aquaculture industry is currently undergoing structural transformation. According to
            2024 data, China, as the world's largest producer, contributes 58% of global aquaculture output, with
            vaccine-dependent species such as shrimp and tilapia accounting for over 40%. Norway's salmon farming
            industry has reduced antibiotic usage by 99% through vaccination technology, setting a significant
            demonstration effect. It is projected that by 2029, the Asia-Pacific region will account for 47% of the
            global aquatic vaccine market, while China's market compound growth rate will reach 11.5%. Physical-driven
            technologies not only reduce vaccine costs but also effectively control disease-related mortality rates,
            aligning with both the evolving needs of the aquaculture market and the development requirements for
            reducing antibiotic dependence and controlling disease transmission through vaccination.</p>


          <h2>2.3 the Monkey King of Creativity —— November 2024</h2>
          <p class="sub">When conceptualizing the fish vaccine project, we sought to create an engaging and accessible
            explanation of how vaccines work. The inspiration came from a classic episode of ”Journey to the West“——
            where Sun Wukong enters Princess Iron Fan's body to solve a problem. This story inspired us: the process of
            vaccines entering fish bodies and providing protection mirrors Sun Wukong's entry into Princess Iron Fan's
            body to resolve her crisis. Through this metaphor, the fish body symbolizes Princess Iron Fan's womb, while
            the vaccine transforms into Sun Wukong-like substance that defends against diseases within the body. We also
            connected the gradual evolution of bacterial cell structures from small to large with Sun Wukong's magical
            ability to transform. By combining scientific principles with this beloved story, we developed a vivid and
            easy-to-understand explanation of vaccination, making complex processes accessible and enjoyable for
            everyone.</p>

          <h2>2.4. Discussion of experimental scheme ——November 2024</h2>
          <p class="sub">We identified three approaches———light-driven, sound-driven, and magnetically driven—to achieve
            external physical signal control of the vaccine bacteria' directional movement for creating "micro-robots".
            After thorough research and discussions, we abandoned the magnetic drive solution due to practical
            limitations and biocompatibility concerns, instead focusing on light-driven and sound-driven systems.</p>

          <img src="/static/upload/page/practicalcontent/practicalcontent8.png" alt="practicalcontent8">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 8. Programme discussion</p>

          <p class="sub">In the research of light-driven technologies, we have discovered an upconversion microgel
            capable of converting near-infrared light into blue light. However, due to its high cost and manufacturing
            challenges, it remains limited to theoretical research at present. Additionally, we developed a blue
            light-responsive transcription system that can enrich engineered microbial communities in fish intestinal
            mucosa. Nevertheless, this technology still requires breakthroughs for integrated applications in
            micro-robots.</p>
          <p class="sub">For the acoustic drive system, considering that fish are difficult to adapt to ultrasonic
            heating, we limit it to enhance bacterial invasion through ultrasound.</p>
          <p class="sub">We have conducted in-depth research on bacterial invasion mechanisms and proposed strategies
            such as outer membrane vesicle construction and targeting peptide design, though these approaches remained
            impractical due to technical limitations. These concepts warrant further exploration. Under Professor Ma
            Yue's guidance, we shifted our focus to achieving directional movement through engineered ——proteins
            (flagella) utilizing optoacoustic synergy. The light-based solution employs a photosensitive promoter to
            regulate CheY and CheZ gene expression, while constructing logic gate circuits for precise navigation. The
            acoustic-driven approach revealed that mechanically sensitive ion channels MscL (or MscS) can activate
            calcium ion influx via ultrasound, thereby enhancing flagellar rotation speed and motility.</p>

          <h1>ON-THE-SPOT-INVESTIGATION</h1>
          <h2>3.1 China Hebei Qinhuangdao Zhenli Aquatic Products —— May 2025 </h2>
          <h3>3.1.1 Background and Purpose</h3>

          <p class="sub">To gain a deeper understanding of the current status of modern aquaculture and the practical
            application of fish vaccination technology, we plan to conduct field research at the Qinhuangdao Fishery in
            Hebei Province, China. As an important fishery base in China, Qinhuangdao not only boasts abundant fishery
            resources but also possesses advanced breeding techniques. This research aims to understand the challenges
            currently faced by the fishery industry, the actual operational procedures for vaccination, and how
            technological innovation drives industrial development through communication with local fishermen and
            fishery enterprises.</p>

          <h3>3.1.2 Practice Content</h3>
          <p class="sub">Upon arriving at Qinhuangdao Aquaculture Farm, we first engaged with the facility manager to
            understand its overall layout, breeding scale, main species, and daily management processes. Through on-site
            inspections of fish ponds, breeding workshops, and related facilities, we gained a comprehensive
            understanding of the entire aquaculture operation. We particularly focused on the farm's smart management
            system, learning how IoT technology enables real-time monitoring of water quality and fish health. During
            our visit, we learned that Qinhuangdao boasts 480,000 mu (approximately 30,000 hectares) of integrated
            marine aquaculture areas combining shallow sea raft farming, ocean ranch bottom seeding, and saltwater pond
            cultivation, along with 1.6 million cubic meters of industrialized aquaculture water bodies. These are
            mainly distributed across Beidaihe New Area and Changle County, primarily cultivating scallops, sea
            cucumbers, flounder, flatfish, half-smooth tongue sole, and shrimp. We also discovered that the
            operational "Jiuteng No.1" intelligent deep-sea cage is equipped with solar photovoltaic power generation
            systems, feed storage modules, underwater video surveillance, and real-time water quality monitoring
            devices, achieving modernized smart aquaculture.</p>

          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 10. Field research</p>

          <h3>3.1.3 Application of Vaccination Techniques</h3>
          <p class="sub">We focused on the practical operations of fishery vaccination. Through in-depth communication
            with technicians and fishermen, we comprehensively understood the advantages and disadvantages of current
            vaccination methods (such as injection and immersion), and explored how to improve vaccination efficiency
            and reduce labor costs in large-scale aquaculture. Additionally, we investigated the application prospects
            of physical drive technologies (such as light-driven and sound-driven systems) in vaccination, analyzing how
            these technologies enhance vaccine utilization rates and immunization effectiveness. It is reported that
            disease issues are particularly prominent in aquaculture processes, with over 200 known pathogens, and
            vaccination is considered the most effective method for preventing and controlling aquatic animal diseases.
            Currently, China has conducted research on more than 50 aquatic vaccines targeting nearly 30 pathogens,
            but their market promotion and application remain limited. As of April 2025, only seven self-developed
            aquatic vaccines have obtained national new veterinary drug certificates.</p>

          <h3>3.1.4 Feedback from fishers and fisheries enterprises</h3>


          <p class="sub">Through face-to-face dialogues with fishermen and representatives from fishery enterprises, we
            gathered their feedback on existing vaccination technologies while gaining insights into practical
            challenges encountered in field operations, including vaccine costs, post-vaccination stress responses in
            fish, and storage requirements. We also explored their acceptance levels and expectations for new
            technologies, as well as how technological innovations could address current challenges. By analyzing local
            market trends for premium aquatic products, we identified consumer priorities regarding health and safety
            standards. The study revealed how fishery enterprises are meeting market demands through technological
            advancements while addressing these concerns. Furthermore, we examined the role of vaccination technology in
            enhancing product quality and boosting market competitiveness within the fisheries sector.</p>

          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 11. Practice exchange and feedback</p>

          <h3>3.1.5 Results and Implications</h3>
          <p class="sub">The field study of Qinhuangdao's aquaculture operations has yielded valuable insights for
            modern aquaculture practices. This research not only optimized vaccination protocols and parameter settings
            to meet practical needs but also enhanced hardware design, validated modular feasibility, and adopted
            adaptive control systems inspired by intelligent management solutions. Through discussions with fishermen
            and industry partners, we identified innovation directions in key technological fields including automated
            injection systems, submerged aquaculture technology, physical drive mechanisms, and integrated monitoring
            systems.</p>




          <h2>3.2 China Hainan Wanning Linlan Group ——June 2025 </h2>
          <h3>3.2.1 Background and purpose</h3>
          <p class="sub">Our project is dedicated to modernizing and ensuring sustainable aquaculture development
            through innovative fish vaccine technologies. To gain in-depth insights into tropical marine fish farming
            practices, particularly the breeding techniques for Oriental sea urchins (Pseudotrichodactylus orientalis),
            we conducted field research at Hainan Wanning Linlan Group. We also participated in their Oriental sea
            urchin breeding training programs and industry networking events with sector leaders.</p>
          <p class="sub">As a leading aquaculture enterprise in Wanning, Hainan, Linlan Group specializes in cultivating
            high-value species such as Oriental sea urchins and red seabream (Pseudotrichodactylus redus). Through
            collaboration with the research team led by Academician Chen Songlin from the Yellow Sea Fisheries Research
            Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the company has achieved a major breakthrough in Oriental sea
            urchin breeding by successfully overcoming key reproductive bottlenecks.</p>

          <h3>3.2.2 Practice Content</h3>
          <p class="sub">Through in-depth communication with the management of Linlan Group, we had a deep understanding
            of the company's development history, business vision, breeding scale, market positioning, etc., and also
            conducted field investigation on the breeding environment of Dongxing Spotted Fish Farm, including key links
            such as fish ponds, feeding, epidemic prevention, etc.</p>

          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 12. Enterprise symposiums</p>

          <p class="sub">Vaccination has emerged as a pivotal strategy in aquaculture disease prevention and control.
            Global research on aquaculture vaccines is closely tied to developing economically sustainable management
            models that prioritize environmental protection [7]. Historically, most approved fish vaccines involved
            combining inactivated pathogens with adjuvants, administered through immersion or injection methods.
            Understanding how Linlan Group integrates these vaccination approaches into its disease prevention system
            holds significant value for our research.</p>


          <h3>3.2.3 Vaccine technical exchanges</h3>
          <p class="sub">Our team participated in the technical training program organized by Linlan Group for Wanning
            Dongxing Fish Farming, where we systematically learned the latest vaccination techniques. Through in-depth
            discussions with technical experts like Academician Chen Songlin, we explored critical aspects such as
            vaccine selection, timing, and dosage control. This exchange provided valuable firsthand data and practical
            experience for our project. An ideal fish vaccine should possess core characteristics including safety,
            efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and ease of administration. During discussions, we focused on how to
            achieve these attributes in Oriental Starfish vaccine development. For instance, ensuring vaccine safety
            means it should not harm fish. In 2024, Uweks Company announced the successful development of a novel
            epitope vaccine that effectively prevents Spondylodermis desiderata virus (SDDV) infection, marking a
            significant step forward in vaccine effectiveness assurance. Understanding how these concepts translate into

          <p class="sub">As a key marine economy hub in Shandong Province, Yantai boasts abundant aquatic resources and
            advanced aquaculture technologies. Tianyuan Aquaculture Co., Ltd., a flagship enterprise in the city's
            aquaculture sector, serves as both a national-level premium flounder breeding center and a provincial-level
            original breeding base. The company maintains industry leadership in marine fish fry cultivation and
            aquaculture practices. This field study examines Tianyuan's aquaculture models, germplasm innovation
            technologies, and disease prevention systems to gain deeper insights into the current state and future
            trends of modern aquaculture, with particular focus on the practical implementation of fish vaccination
            techniques.</p>
          <h3>3.5.2 Practice Content</h3>
          <p class="sub">The research team first examined Tianyuan Aquaculture's industrialized recirculating
            aquaculture system. The company began conducting feasibility studies, design, and preparatory work for
            semi-closed recirculating aquaculture in 2008, officially commencing production in March 205. The system
            currently maintains approximately 1,600 cubic meters of semi-closed recirculating water bodies, primarily
            cultivating turbot (also known as mandarin fish). The water treatment process follows a closed-loop path:
            "reclaimed water → recirculation pumps → elevated tank → temperature regulation pool → oxygenation →
            disinfection → breeding pond," with daily seawater replenishment at about 5% and complete water replacement
            every 6-7 days. Equipped with pure oxygen tanks and two sets of recirculating water treatment systems, the
            facility achieves a processing capacity of 200 cubic meters per hour. The water clarity in breeding areas
            reaches approximately 40 centimeters, ensuring optimal aquatic conditions. Compared to traditional open
            aquaculture models, Tianyuan's recirculating system demonstrates significant advantages. Data shows this
            system saves 85% water and 50% electricity compared to conventional methods. In turbot cultivation, initial
            stocking fry weighing 280-300 grams at a density of 30 kg/m³ can reach an average weight of 65 grams within
            120 days, achieving a 5% higher growth rate than conventional approaches.</p>

          <h2>3.6 Liaoning Huludao Individual Farmers Exchange in China--September 2025 </h2>
          <h3>3.6.1 Background and Purpose</h3>
          <p class="sub">As an important aquaculture base in Liaoning Province, Huludao City holds a unique position in
            China's aquaculture industry. Located in southwestern Liaoning and adjacent to the Bohai Sea, the area lies
            within the north latitude 40° golden aquaculture belt, with abundant natural well salt water resources
            underground. The production of turbot in Huludao accounts for approximately 58% of China's total aquaculture
            output, earning it the reputation that "one out of every two mandarin fish consumed worldwide originates
            from Huludao." This practical research aims to investigate the actual operational conditions of individual
            farmers in Huludao who face relatively backward breeding facilities and outdated equipment. We particularly
            focus on the unique challenges these small-scale farmers encounter in seedling selection, farming models,
            disease prevention, and marketing, seeking to identify key factors constraining their development and
            providing empirical evidence for improving production conditions for small-scale farmers.</p>
          <h3>3.6.2 Practice Content</h3>
          <p class="sub">The survey primarily targeted small-scale aquaculture operators, particularly those with
            relatively outdated facilities and basic equipment. We conducted in-depth face-to-face interviews with over
            20 individual aquaculture businesses, all operating on a small scale with investment amounts ranging from
            tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan.</p>
          <p class="sub">The infrastructure of individual aquaculture operators in Huludao remains rudimentary, with
            relatively outdated breeding conditions. Most small-scale operators use basic fish farming sheds and ponds
            lacking modern recirculating water systems and temperature control equipment. Compared to large-scale
            enterprises, these independent farmers face significant underinvestment in facilities, which hinders the
            improvement of breeding efficiency. At the Cold Water Aquaculture Cooperative in Xianglushan Village,
            Xintaimen Town, Lianshan District, we observed relatively simple facilities: "At the foot of the mountain,
            over 30 fish ponds measuring 6 meters wide and 5-18 meters long are visible, with rows of small injectors
            resembling miniature waterfalls channeling clear spring water into the pools." While this nature-dependent
            approach requires minimal investment, it suffers from high environmental sensitivity and low productivity.
            In contrast, large-scale enterprises typically employ factory-style recirculating aquaculture systems that
            enable precise environmental control. Limited by financial constraints, small operators struggle to upgrade
            their infrastructure, remaining stuck with traditional farming methods. This disparity in facilities
            directly impacts breeding density, survival rates, and product quality.</p>

          <img src="/static/upload/page/practicalcontent/practicalcontent18.png" alt="practicalcontent18">
          <p class="figurecaption">Figure 18. Talk with farmers</p>

          <h3>3.6.3 Key Challenges and Dilemmas</h3>
          <p class="sub">Funding shortages remain the primary obstacle hindering the development of individual
            aquaculture businesses in Huludao. Small-scale operators commonly face dual challenges: inadequate initial
            investments and tight operating budgets. The substantial capital required for establishing breeding
            facilities and purchasing equipment proves particularly challenging, as these entrepreneurs typically lack
            sufficient personal funds to cover such expenses.</p>
          <p class="sub">Technological backwardness remains a critical challenge for individual aquaculture operators in
            Huludao. Small-scale farmers generally lack professional expertise and technical support in breeding
            techniques, disease prevention, and water quality management, relying primarily on traditional experience to
            make farming decisions. This technological deficiency not only reduces production efficiency but also
            heightens operational risks in the industry.</p>

          <h3>3.6.4 Optimization Suggestions</h3>
          <p class="sub">To enhance the competitiveness of individual aquaculture operators in Huludao, priority should
            be given to upgrading infrastructure and modernizing equipment. The government and enterprises must
            collaborate to assist these operators in renovating their facilities, promoting practical technologies and
            advanced equipment, thereby advancing the sector's modernization. Specific measures could include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Promoting practical aquaculture models: Tailored to individual farmers 'needs, we advocate
              low-investment and easy-to-implement farming approaches. A prime example is the "Large Flatfish +
              Shellfish" integrated cultivation model, which reduces annual pollutant emissions by 2,000 tons and has
              been recognized as a "Green Aquaculture Model Case Study" by China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
              Affairs.</li>
            <li>Provide equipment subsidies or leasing services: In view of the shortage of funds for individual
              businesses, small-scale and low-cost technical equipment subsidies can be provided, or equipment leasing
              platforms can be established to reduce the threshold of technology application for individual businesses.
            </li>
            <li>Strengthening infrastructure co-construction and sharing: Encourage individual businesses to build and
              share water treatment facilities, cold chain logistics and other infrastructure through cooperatives, so
              as to improve the efficiency of resource utilization.</li>
